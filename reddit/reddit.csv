Why don’t they just put the water in the Grand Canyon? Or somewhere just as big? The longest oil/gas pipeline is 2550 odd miles long_ the Grand Canyon is 500 odd miles away from the nearest ocean build massive pipes and pumps and start pumping sea water_ to offset the amount that is melting. I’m sure with solar power this could help power the pumps - just a thought. If we can’t reverse it can we place somewhere else.
