Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,23,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.
Mon Feb 17 03:03:55 SGT 2020,7,What is the #1 scientifically proven way to prevent the Earth from warming?  I've heard many people focus in different areas, but what is #1 way we can prevent the Earth from warming?
Mon Feb 17 01:25:23 SGT 2020,6,So many questions! I have gotten some killer satisfying answers though so thank you!

I know that the US is (and formerly was to a much greater extent) engaged in much self-regulation and things like the Paris Climate accord to help mitigate the problem. My question is this:

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?
Sun Feb 16 22:11:26 SGT 2020,1,The world has tested thousands of nukes in the last 100 years. I read once that a nuke explosion burns hotter than the sun, and it obviously throws a lot of stuff into the atmosphere. Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?
Sun Feb 16 23:38:45 SGT 2020,0,I have been working some hours in my garden today. In a light sweater and light trousers. It was 18 degrees Celsius/ 64 °F. I live in Germany. I already fear the coming months..
Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Without fail, every winter, someone will point out how cold it is and use it as evidence that climate change is not occurring. And, -also without fail- someone will respond WEATHER👏🏻 IS 👏🏻NOT👏🏻 CLIMATE👏🏻

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.

Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,24,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.

Mon Feb 17 01:25:23 SGT 2020,5,So many questions! I have gotten some killer satisfying answers though so thank you!

I know that the US is (and formerly was to a much greater extent) engaged in much self-regulation and things like the Paris Climate accord to help mitigate the problem. My question is this:

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?
Sun Feb 16 22:11:26 SGT 2020,1,The world has tested thousands of nukes in the last 100 years. I read once that a nuke explosion burns hotter than the sun, and it obviously throws a lot of stuff into the atmosphere. Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?
Sun Feb 16 23:38:45 SGT 2020,0,I have been working some hours in my garden today. In a light sweater and light trousers. It was 18 degrees Celsius/ 64 °F. I live in Germany. I already fear the coming months..
Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.
Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,23,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.

Mon Feb 17 01:25:23 SGT 2020,5,So many questions! I have gotten some killer satisfying answers though so thank you!

I know that the US is (and formerly was to a much greater extent) engaged in much self-regulation and things like the Paris Climate accord to help mitigate the problem. My question is this:

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?
Sun Feb 16 22:11:26 SGT 2020,1,The world has tested thousands of nukes in the last 100 years. I read once that a nuke explosion burns hotter than the sun, and it obviously throws a lot of stuff into the atmosphere. Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?

Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Without fail, every winter, someone will point out how cold it is and use it as evidence that climate change is not occurring. And, -also without fail- someone will respond WEATHER👏🏻 IS 👏🏻NOT👏🏻 CLIMATE👏🏻

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.
Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,23,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.

Mon Feb 17 01:25:23 SGT 2020,5,So many questions! I have gotten some killer satisfying answers though so thank you!

I know that the US is (and formerly was to a much greater extent) engaged in much self-regulation and things like the Paris Climate accord to help mitigate the problem. My question is this:

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?

Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?
Sun Feb 16 23:38:45 SGT 2020,0,I have been working some hours in my garden today. In a light sweater and light trousers. It was 18 degrees Celsius/ 64 °F. I live in Germany. I already fear the coming months..
Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Without fail, every winter, someone will point out how cold it is and use it as evidence that climate change is not occurring. And, -also without fail- someone will respond WEATHER👏🏻 IS 👏🏻NOT👏🏻 CLIMATE👏🏻

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.
Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,23,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.
Mon Feb 17 03:03:55 SGT 2020,7,What is the #1 scientifically proven way to prevent the Earth from warming?  I've heard many people focus in different areas, but what is #1 way we can prevent the Earth from warming?
Mon Feb 17 01:25:23 SGT 2020,4,So many questions! I have gotten some killer satisfying answers though so thank you!

I know that the US is (and formerly was to a much greater extent) engaged in much self-regulation and things like the Paris Climate accord to help mitigate the problem. My question is this:

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?

Sun Feb 16 22:11:26 SGT 2020,1,The world has tested thousands of nukes in the last 100 years. I read once that a nuke explosion burns hotter than the sun, and it obviously throws a lot of stuff into the atmosphere. Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?
Sun Feb 16 23:38:45 SGT 2020,0,I have been working some hours in my garden today. In a light sweater and light trousers. It was 18 degrees Celsius/ 64 °F. I live in Germany. I already fear the coming months..
Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Without fail, every winter, someone will point out how cold it is and use it as evidence that climate change is not occurring. And, -also without fail- someone will respond WEATHER👏🏻 IS 👏🏻NOT👏🏻 CLIMATE👏🏻

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.
Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,23,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.

An oft-cited statement by prison reform advocates is “the US houses only 5 percent of the population yet incarcerates “X” (30-50 percent) of the world’s prisoners.

So how can a country with only a small fraction of the world population make all the difference? Aren’t the biggest offenders China and India? Are they doing their part? Should we even bother if they don’t?
Sun Feb 16 22:11:26 SGT 2020,1,The world has tested thousands of nukes in the last 100 years. I read once that a nuke explosion burns hotter than the sun, and it obviously throws a lot of stuff into the atmosphere. Does this not have more of an effect on our climate than CO2 from coal-powered electric plants, or does this just not have much of an effect on climate at all in the long run?
Sun Feb 16 23:38:45 SGT 2020,0,I have been working some hours in my garden today. In a light sweater and light trousers. It was 18 degrees Celsius/ 64 °F. I live in Germany. I already fear the coming months..
Sun Feb 16 22:08:10 SGT 2020,0,Is there a rational explanation for this?

Without fail, every winter, someone will point out how cold it is and use it as evidence that climate change is not occurring. And, -also without fail- someone will respond WEATHER👏🏻 IS 👏🏻NOT👏🏻 CLIMATE👏🏻

Then summer comes around, and everyone including the media is posting article after article about the hot summer being evidence of climate change.

So which is it? Is this just typical hypocrisy, or is hot weather somehow more evidence of climate pattern than cold weather? I am genuinely curious.
Mon Feb 17 01:21:44 SGT 2020,22,Oke so me and my gf bought a house together and we have discussions about the climate. We both both wanna do better. At the moment now I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to start to combat climate change. Basically I took this steps already: 

1. Less shower.   
2. Get local vegetables at a farmers near my home.   
3. Eat less meat and make it more of luxury so I don't mind paying more for meat that are from animals in my area .   
4. Use bike and more public transport.   
5. I got 3 older sun panels from my dad.   
6. We pay for green electricity.   
7. When we are not home or asleep we put the heater off.  


We have 1 car. I have to drive 20minutes to work. Gf bikes to work its only 3 minutes so. 

I wanna give up more on car driving.. Take the train more to work and winter sport holidays I wanna go with the train to the mountains (I live in the Netherlands and Europe has easy connections with the train). Already bought a bag for my skies for easy transport. So I'm already giving up my car more.. 

What bothers me is that every time I think oke I get more green like example solar panels you just get backfired that also that is not that green as we think.   
If I could pay for electric car I would to that but that has to wait (Also the way those battery are getting made is bad for the climate blabla..). But I want and need to step up more. Watching the news about climate change makes me depressed.. 

What I need to know now is what is a good road to take and aim for a better footprint in this world.   
Also more tips and tricks are welcome.
