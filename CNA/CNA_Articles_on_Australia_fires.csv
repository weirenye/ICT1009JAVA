Australian bushfires extinguished, but climate rows rage on=15 Feb 2020 11:08AM=AFP/ga=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australian-bushfires-extinguished--but-climate-rows-rage-on-12437798=" SYDNEY: Australia's "black summer" of devastating bushfires is finally coming to a close, but bitter arguments over how to tackle climate-fuelled disasters are raging on. When firefighters announced this week that all blazes in the hard-hit state of New South Wales were under control for the first time since September, the relief was palpable. In other regions, a few fires are still being contained, but most Australians can finally abandon the grim rituals of the last half-year - morning checks of smog monitors and "Fires Near Me" apps, deciding whether the kids can play outside, whether to flee or defend their homes. But the after-effects will endure, and national soul searching has already begun. "We know events like these can challenge the way we think about the world, undermine our perceptions of safety, and rupture social bonds," said disaster response expert Erin Smith. Dozens of families have lost loved ones, thousands of homes and farms have been gutted, swathes of the east coast are scarred charcoal-black and millions have had their sense of security shaken. "It will likely take years and a great deal of imagination for us to figure out where we go from here," said Smith. The question of what is next for Australia is already being asked, most of all of political leaders, and it is being met mostly with finger-pointing and recrimination. "HEADS ABOVE THE PARAPET" While scientists agree climate change created favourable conditions for the blazes, politicians of all stripes are acutely aware how sensitive the issue is in Australian politics. In an arid nation whose economic strength is intimately tied to the mining and export of fossil fuels, at least four prime ministers have been ousted in part over their climate policies. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has seen his ruling conservative coalition threatened by members in rural constituencies demanding funding for more coal-fired power plants. At the same time, the centrist wing of his party has criticised his climate targets as inadequate. Meanwhile rebel members of opposition Labor met secretly to steer the centre-left party's leadership toward a more overtly pro-coal stance. The party's deputy leader awkwardly refused to rule out more coal subsidies, months after vowing they should end. "They don't want to stick their heads above the parapet, at least when it comes to suggesting substantive policy," said Matt McDonald, an expert in climate politics from the University of Queensland. One reason, he explained, is that while the hot and dry Australian continent is uniquely susceptible to the impact of climate change, it is also a world-beating source of coal. Coal accounts for around 75 per cent of Australia's electricity generation and exports of the fossil fuel are worth A$60 billion a year, the country's largest export after iron ore. People in affluent suburbs may call for emissions cuts and green energy, but coal accounts for thousands of jobs in election-deciding districts of Queensland and New South Wales, and many more in the related aluminium smelting business. Independent MP Zali Steggall - a former barrister and Olympic medal-winning skier - who ousted climate-sceptic former prime minister Tony Abbott from his Sydney seat at the last election, wants to take some heat out of the debate. She has introduced a bill that would reduce Australia's carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and divert some contentious issues to an independent expert body. "The debate has been very divisive," in part because of the blame game, Steggall told AFP. "There was a certain defensiveness in the early days of this debate because the finger was so squarely pointed at coal and fossil fuels." "You have to think about a generation that worked really hard at building Australia's prosperity on fossil fuels. You have to be very careful in the debate about apportioning blame. It's not like it was done on purpose." "It's about recognising and being thankful for that contribution, but acknowledging that we do need to evolve," she added. "We're all going to get there in the end." With bushfires projected to get even more deadly and the next season a little over six months away, the risk, Steggall says, is that politicians take so long to reach consensus "it will be too late to do anything"."
Fires contained in hard-hit Australia state, but now floods threaten=13 Feb 2020 05:45PM=AFP/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-fires-contained-flood-threat-12431520=" SYDNEY: All the blazes in Australia's hard-hit state of New South Wales have been brought under control, firefighters said on Thursday (Feb 13), signalling the end of a "black summer" that claimed 33 lives nationwide. But heavy rains that helped extinguish the blazes that have raged along the east coast since September are causing flash floods in parts of the state, posing new problems for some residents. "Not all fires are out, there's still some fire activity in the far south of the state but all fires are contained so we can really focus on helping people rebuild," the state's fire service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said on Twitter.   "It is very good news," a Rural Fire Service spokesman told AFP. Bushfires scorched more than 10 million hectares in the country's east and south, killing at least 33 people and an estimated one billion animals, while destroying more than 2,500 homes. The crisis cloaked major cities including Sydney in smoke for weeks on end, saw towns cut off and prompted the deployment of the military to rescue stranded citizens. Beleaguered volunteer firefighters have fought the blazes day-in-day-out in what has been described as Australia's "black summer". The fires were exacerbated by prolonged drought and worsened by climate change in the country's hottest and driest year on record. NOT THREATENING Days of recent rainfall have extinguished the largest fires and brought those that remain under control. In the Australian Capital Territory around Canberra firefighters are still trying to bring one blaze under control, but it was not said to be threatening. Attention has now turned to tackling flash flooding expected in the coming days following the heaviest rains in 30 years. On Thursday dams near Sydney overflowed after days of torrential rain, a spectacular reversal from months of drought. The Nepean dam was just a third full less than a week ago, but on Thursday video footage showing water cascading over the dam wall. Hundreds of people have been rescued from floodwaters in recent days. Wild weather is set to ramp up again from Friday, with the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting ex-Tropical Cyclone Uesi would bring "damaging to destructive winds" and heavy rainfall to remote tourist destination Lord Howe Island. Senior meteorologist Grace Legge said storms were also expected for Queensland and New South Wales -- with areas still recovering from bushfires likely to be hit again. "Any showers and thunderstorms that do develop are falling on already saturated catchments, so there is a risk with severe thunderstorms of flash flooding," she said."
In fire-hit rural Australia, climate debate burns deep=11 Feb 2020 07:28PM (Updated: 11 Feb 2020 07:47PM)=Reuters/jt=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/in-fire-hit-rural-australia--climate-debate-burns-deep-12422084=" BUCHAN, Australia: Returning from a morning feeding his sheep, Jeff McCole, a 70-year-old farmer, paused to take in the bittersweet scene – a few droplets of rain falling onto the remains of his fire-ravaged home. "Nothing like the sound of rain on a tin roof," he said, as he scanned the residue of a lifetime of memories scattered before him. By the old front door was a charred metal toy truck his grandchildren once raced down the verandah. Under the remains of the tin roof, a collection of books, his wife's "pride and joy", had been reduced to layers of feathery ash. And out back, the skeleton of a Valencia orange tree, planted by his mother 65 years ago, was now laden with baubles of charcoaled fruit.   Seasonal bushfires have struck Australia in a way like never before, making for months of monster blazes and toxic haze, and fuelling a polarising debate over climate change. But in Buchan, a conservative-voting farming town in Victoria state that is home to the McCole farm, most locals said they believed the catastrophic fires had nothing to do with global warming. Climate change was "a load of crap", said McCole, an idea pushed by city folk with "no experience in the bush" and no understanding of Australia's punishing, cyclical climate. "We've had severe droughts and everything like that, 70 years ago," said McCole, a Vietnam war veteran with sky-blue eyes. "It just keeps going around in circles. If you wait, it's going to change." RISING RISKS For decades scientists have warned that climate change would increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia. This year, there was the perfect storm – record-breaking drought and heat coalescing on tinderbox land. Before rains slowed their spread in recent days, the fires had burned through almost 12 million hectares, destroyed more than 2,800 homes, and claimed the lives of 33 people. An estimated one billion native animals are also believed to have died. Australia has one of the world's highest carbon footprints per capita and is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas, making successive governments reluctant to adopt climate change policies they say could undermine the economy. But with these unprecedented bushfires, the government has come under increased pressure from environmental groups, scientists and broader swathes of the Australian public to address the climate change issue. "People are more fearful of the future because they glimpsed the future this summer," said Lesley Hughes, a professor and climate scientist at Macquarie University. "I think it has been really wounding of the Australian psyche."   Polling by the Australia Institute, a Canberra think tank, in January found that 79 per cent of Australians said they were concerned about climate change, up five percentage points from last July, with 47per cent "very concerned", a jump of 10 points. But there remains widespread scepticism that the severity of the fires is due to climate change, with many conservative politicians and media suggesting that factors such as arson, the length of cyclical droughts or poor management of flammable vegetation are more responsible. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had previously declined to discuss the link between climate change and the fires, recently acknowledged the connection, but said his priority was managing the economic impact. Morrison last week cited "hazard reduction" – which includes the practice of controlled burns to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the bush, as a key to mitigating fires in the future, saying it was just as important as reducing emissions. Climate scientists say that the bigger problem for Australia are longer droughts and increasingly hot summers.   The issue of controlled burns is a deeply emotional one in Buchan, where at least 20 homes were lost in the fires that struck in December. "Climate change or not," said Donald Graham, a farmer who survived the fires huddled in his concrete bunker with a stack of cheese and vegemite sandwiches. "These fires were a disaster waiting to happen." A DEATH TRAP The road from Melbourne to Buchan winds past a series of small country towns, pie shops and historic churches and, after a weekend of rain, verdant green fields with dairy cows. But closer to Buchan, population 385, the road is eerily burnt out, lined by rows of black tree trunks sticking out of ashy ground. When the bushfires hit the town on Dec. 30, they roared in on three fronts with a ferocity that no locals had ever seen. For more than a month, fires had raged ominously in nearby bushland, finally bellowing in with "one heck of a red glow", McCole said.   From the verandah of his home, nestled on a 400-hectare property of rolling hills, gum trees and Merino sheep, he watched a giant orange plume crest over the hill and rain down fiery embers. "We only had ten minutes to get out and I think that was the best call I ever made," he said with a wry laugh. "It was a death trap." The town of Buchan is a single main street with a general store and a pub - the kind of place where locals have time to discuss the pressing issues of the day with a stranger. "The issue of climate change and the fire is a dead duck as far as I'm concerned," said Graham, an animated 68-year-old cattleman with a shock of gray hair. "What is the most significant thing, is the changing structure of the forest." Minutes before he watched his house go up in flames from the peephole of his bunker, Graham raced inside to grab a picture from the wall, a colonial lithograph featuring the magnificent valley below overlooking the confluence of the Snowy and Buchan rivers.   The picture is significant because it shows how much the land has changed, he said. "We've got an accumulation of vegetation. Our area was burned 50 to 70 years ago and it has not burned since, and at some point it will burn," he said. "It just needs a few things to come together, a few dry years and some lightning and neither of those are peculiar to the Australian landscape." His neighbour John Coates, a 76-year-old cattle farmer, said that decades of vegetation growth had turned the land into a "timebomb". Walking through their property overlooking the Snowy River National Park, Coates and his wife Janice shook their heads at the destruction – bald, blackened hills and the devastated gorge below, once filled with ferns, lyrebirds and platypus in the creek. Many locals in Buchan recall the days they would carry a box of matches in their pockets so they could carry out their own hazard-reduction burns. But regulations subsequently put in place aimed at protecting state forests and bushland mean they are now dependent on government agencies for carrying out controlled burns. For years, local farmers had urged the government to carry out burns to reduce the "fuel load", or the accumulation of trees, underbrush and dry grass that can turn a small bushfire into an inferno, Coates said. But it never happened.   Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer for Forest Fire Management Victoria, said in a statement to Reuters that his agency had planned to burn 246,396 hectares of the state's public land last year, but was "unable to do so because it would have been unsafe". Scientists also say the drought and increasingly hot weather means there are fewer days that vegetation can be safely burned. Commenting on the issue in New South Wales, Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said it was not a case of failing to implement techniques that had worked in the past, but that such techniques were "insufficient to address the scenario now". "You can't blame the dry conditions and say it has no relevance to climate change," he said. "It's a combination of many different climatic changes that can be linked back to the overall trend." SEASONS 'OUT OF SYNC' In Buchan, not everyone in town was averse to talk of climate change – a few spoke of the seasons being "out of sync", the lack of rain or the demise of fragrant yellow box flowers in the valley. But the fires have mainly reinforced pre-existing views and gripes, reflecting the polarising rhetoric of the national climate change debate. Last November, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack – who heads the party that won in the electorate that includes Buchan – described climate change concerns as those held by "inner-city raving lunatics".   That messaging appeared to resonate in Buchan, far from the skyscrapers and the lights of Melbourne or Sydney, with a strong sense that people here were living far greener lives. "They blame our cows," said McCole, referring to recent attention on the earth-warming methane produced by belching or flatulent cattle. But, he said, "they are all jumping on electric trains and cars and god knows what in the city and there are millions of them, flying around the world in jumbo jets." "It takes a good cow to put out that many emissions," he said. "I can tell ya.""
Rains forecast to douse Australia wildfires, raising hopes crisis nearly over=11 Feb 2020 06:49PM=Reuters/jt=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/rains-forecast-to-douse-australia-wildfires--raising-hopes-crisis-nearly-over-12423196=" SYDNEY: Torrential rain across Australia's east could extinguish all remaining bushfires in the country's most populous state by the end of the week, authorities said on Tuesday (Feb 11), raising hopes a deadly national crisis is almost over. Australia has been battling hundreds of blazes since September in an unusually prolonged summer wildfire season that was fuelled by three years of drought, which experts have attributed to climate change. Heavy rain and storms have in recent days swept across New South Wales (NSW) state, which bore the brunt of a crisis that engulfed several states and territories at its peak. The downpour has already doused two of the biggest and longest running blazes and NSW officials are hopeful that more rain forecast for this week will extinguish the remaining 24 fires, four of which are burning "uncontrolled".   "All going well, all will be contained and we're hopeful to get to a stage where we can call them out," the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) said in an emailed statement. The current situation is a far cry from the height of the crisis in early January when NSW firefighters were battling almost 150 fires that produced a firefront about 6,000km long. Blazes across the country have razed nearly 12 million hectares of tinder-dry bushland, killing 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals, since September. The fires destroyed thousands of homes and prompted mass evacuations of both locals and tourists under apocalyptic-like red skies during Australia's peak summer holiday period.   Hawkesbury City Mayor Barry Calvert said the dousing of the massive Gospers Mountain fire this week was a huge relief. "We've been living with this fire for four months," he told Reuters by telephone. "We could never relax. For several weeks, we all had our bags packed ready to evacuate as the fire would move quickly in different directions depending on how the wind changed." "The smoke would also get you down, we were desperate for some clean air." WELCOME SURPRISE The welcome rainfall has come as something of an early surprise. The Bureau of Meteorology in January said rains sufficient enough to extinguish the fires was unlikely until at least March. In neighbouring Victoria state, firefighters were battling around 20 blazes on Tuesday - down from a peak of 60. Heavy rain was also forecast in Victoria for coming days, although officials expect it to dampen, rather than extinguish, many of the fires. "The lower end rainfall totals won't put out fires, they will allow them to be contained or controlled by firefighters in the near future," Victorian State Response Controller Tim Wiebusch told reporters in Melbourne.   In Queensland state, which also received heavy rainfalls, just one fire remains ablaze, while nine fires are alight in South Australia south. The rainfall has, however, proved to be a double-edged sword. Nearly 60,000 households across NSW remained without electricity on Tuesday as flash flooding bought down powerlines and trees."
Floods fail to end Australia's years-long drought=11 Feb 2020 05:59PM=AFP/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfire-drought-floods-weather-12422950=" SYDNEY: Heavy rain has given hope to Australia's drought-stricken regions, but scientists warned Tuesday (Feb 11) sustained falls were needed to end a years-long dry spell. Stormy weather has brought days of chaos and destruction in the country's east, with one man missing after his car was swept off a road in Sydney's north and hundreds more rescued from floodwaters. In the small town of Stanthorpe, Queensland, Tracy Dobie said the rain had been "a boost for everyone". "But the drought has not ended," the regional mayor told AFP. "Our land is so dehydrated - we've gone three years without rain in some places and five years in others - it's going to take a long time to get moisture back in the soil." Hydrologists believe this week's deluge - which has caused flooding and doused many fires - is a taste of things to come, with cities getting inundated while rural areas struggle to offset worsening droughts. Professor Ashish Sharma from the University of New South Wales said heavy rain can give people in cities a "twisted view" of the impact, as water builds up on hard surfaces. Even as people in cities see flooding and property damage, in rural regions sustained rainfall is needed to soak through the dry soil before dams fill. During the latest downpours - the heaviest in 30 years in some areas - dam levels near Sydney have risen dramatically. But most of New South Wales' drought-hit towns facing down a water "Day Zero" had seen "negligible" increases, as much of the rain was flowing into rivers not dams, said a spokesman for WaterNSW, which manages the state's water resources. "Unfortunately (that is) largely because the volume hasn't been sufficient and the catchments are extremely dry after a very hot start to the summer and a prolonged drought," he said. Despite climate change driving increases in extreme rainfall, Sharma and his team predict it will not be enough to keep up with rising temperatures. Moderate and frequent floods, which form "the backbone of all our water supply", will likely decrease, Sharma said. "I just hope that people have the wisdom and the foresight to realise that this should not be seen as a sign of not needing to act," he added. Dobie said the rain was more than welcome but "one rain event doesn't close the door on the drought". "We need a year of average rainfall.""
Downpours to end Australia bushfires within days=10 Feb 2020 04:10PM (Updated: 10 Feb 2020 04:13PM)=AFP=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-end-rain-12417138=" SYDNEY: Australia's months-long bushfire crisis will likely be over within days, officials said Monday (Feb 10) as heavy rainfall extinguished several massive blazes and was forecast to douse dozens more as downpours swept south. Days of torrential rains have caused flash flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, dampening once-raging fires that volunteers had battled in vain for months. Sydney experienced its wettest period in 20 years amid several days of heavy rainfall that led to chaotic scenes across the city. The Bureau of Meteorology said 391.6mm (15.42 inches) of rain fell in Sydney over the past four days - the highest total in such a period since 414.2mm were recorded in February 1990. Several major bushfires have been extinguished by the deluge, including a "mega-blaze" that burned through 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) north of Sydney and a similar-sized fire to the city's south, bringing relief to residents and firefighters. New South Wales Rural Fire Service spokesman James Morris said about 30 fires were still burning Monday, but it was expected they would soon be extinguished as the rain moves south in the coming days. "By the end of the week it's likely they will be out," he told AFP. Drought-stricken areas across the country's east also received welcome downpours but more sustained and widespread rainfall will be needed to offset a years-long dry spell. The stormy weather has brought days of chaos and destruction, with one man missing after his car was swept off a road in Sydney's north and hundreds more rescued from floodwaters across the state. Police said a search was under way for the missing man Monday but no sign of him or his vehicle had been found. Several rivers, including the Parramatta River in Sydney's west, overflowed while residents living near Narrabeen Lagoon in the city's north were ordered to evacuate late Sunday amid fears their homes could be inundated. Emergency services scrambled to respond to calls for assistance as strong winds uprooted trees, ocean foam coated seaside homes and boulders fell on parked cars. Almost 90,000 homes remained without power Monday, with utility providers warning it could take days for electricity to be restored in some areas. The Insurance Council of Australia said insurers had received an estimated A$45 million (US$30 million) in claims by early Monday, with that figure expected to rise as the full extent of the damage becomes clear."
Heavy rain douses Australia's east coast bushfires=10 Feb 2020 07:14AM=Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/heavy-rain-douses-australia-s-east-coast-bushfires-12415264=" MELBOURNE: Australian authorities issued evacuation orders as heavy rain lashed Sydney and the east coast of the state of New South Wales (NSW) on Monday (Feb 10), bringing chaos to the country's largest city while dousing bushfires that have raged since November. Between 200 and 400 millimetres of rain drenched the Sydney area out to the Blue Mountains and farther south over the weekend, the Bureau of Meteorology said, which led to rivers flooding and forced more than 60 schools to shut on Monday. The NSW State Emergency Service received over 2,700 calls for help overnight, with the number of calls since last Wednesday topping 10,000, SES spokesman Andrew Richards said. "It's certainly quite a significant event. It's led to a record number of calls to our call centre. It's quite widespread," NSW State Emergency Service (SES) spokesman Andrew Richards said. "Couple that with gale-force winds off the coast, large six-metre waves, the coastline's getting pretty hammered as well with the high tides and king tides." The Bureau of Meteorology warned that heavy rain could lead to life-threatening flash flooding for the south coast of New South Wales and also said there could be wind gusts of more than 90 kilometres per hour. Thanks to the rain, the NSW Rural Fire Service on Sunday night declared that one of the state's worst bushfires, Currawon on the south coast, was finally out. The fire had burned for 74 days, destroying 312 homes and razing nearly 500,000 hectares of land. There were still 33 fires burning as of Monday morning in the state, but they were all at the lowest warning level of "advice" and mostly in southeastern areas where the rains were headed. Farmers welcomed the rain but said the water was not going deep enough into the ground to end three years of drought. "It's a really good start to the year. Unfortunately, it's not drought-breaking," Nigel Cornish, a Queensland farmer who is a director of industry group Grain Growers, told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. The drought has contributed to a horrific fire season that has killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and burned more than 11.7 million hectares of land since September."
Bushfires, cyclone, torrential rain hit Australia's coasts=09 Feb 2020 03:39PM=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-cyclone-weather-bushfire-flooding-12412422=" MELBOURNE: Severe bushfires burned through parts of Western Australia on Sunday (Feb 9), with other areas of the state dealing with the aftermath of a powerful cyclone, while the country's east coast was facing potential life-threatening flash flooding. After months of destructive wildfires that have razed millions of hectares of land, Australia has been hit in recent weeks by wild weather that has alternately brought heavy downpours, hail storms, gusty winds and hot and dry air. About a dozen fires were burning in Western Australia (WA) on Sunday, with severe fire danger expected in several districts, according to fire services and the state's Bureau of Meteorology. Daytime temperatures in some of the districts were forecast at up to 42 degrees Celsius. The state's upper parts were battling on Sunday the aftermath of a tropical cyclone Damien that made a landfall on Saturday afternoon, bringing gusty winds of up to 200kph.   No immediate damages were reported and the cyclone was expected to weaken as it moved inland, but winds were seen to blow at more than 100kph. "Although Tropical #CycloneDamien has weakened significantly from the thrashing it gave Karratha and Dampier yesterday, areas around Tom Price and Paraburdoo are receiving significant rainfall and squally conditions," the state's Bureau of Meteorology said on its Twitter account. On the opposite coast of Australia, Sydney and the state of New South Wales were in danger of potential life-threatening flash flooding as rain kept bucketing down for a third day in a row in downpours not seen since 1998. Rainfall in some parts of the state approached half the annual average, but the falls were welcomed after the state saw its driest year on record in 2019, at 55 per cent below average. The state's Bureau of Meteorology said there was potential for heavy "rainfall and life-threatening flash-flooding," and coast erosion, although little danger of river flooding as water levels have been low due to a persistent drought. In Queensland, meteorologists also warned of flash and riverine flooding on Sunday, following heavy falls overnight. An emergency flood alert was issued for residents of Dalby due to a creek overflowing, about 200km west of Brisbane."
Torrential rain now affecting sports in Australia=08 Feb 2020 01:45PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/torrential-rain-now-affecting-sports-in-australia-12410600=" SYDNEY: Torrential rain has forced the postponement of an A-League derby match in Sydney on Saturday, continuing the run of sports events affected by adverse weather conditions in Australia. The clash between the league-leading Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers had been scheduled to be held at Kograh Oval on Saturday evening. Football Federation Australia (FFA) officials, however, postponed the match after an inspection of the venue earlier on Saturday and in consultation with the clubs and broadcasters. "With over 100 millimetres of rain falling in the Sydney area over the past two days, and in the interest of player welfare, all parties agreed that it was not possible to play the match as scheduled," FFA Head of Leagues Greg O'Rourke said. "Whilst it is disappointing that a nearly sold-out crowd is unable to see another iconic Sydney derby today, this was the right decision." FFA said the match would be rescheduled following discussions with the clubs and broadcasters. The soccer clash was not the only top-level sport affected on Saturday, with the final of the domestic Twenty20 Big Bash cricket league between the Sydney Sixers and Melbourne Stars also in jeopardy. Australian sports events have been badly affected by adverse weather in the last few months, principally due to bushfires. A Big Bash match in Canberra was abandoned in December due to bushfire smoke, while players attempting to qualify for the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam in Melbourne in early January complained of not being able to breathe properly. The fires, however, have actually been doused in the last 24 hours by the biggest rainfall in almost 20 years, while Western Australia is also bracing for a lashing from severe tropical cyclone Damien.

Australia welcomes drought-easing drenching, even as it brings floods=07 Feb 2020 06:42AM=Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-welcomes-drought-easing-drenching--even-as-it-brings-floods-12403292=" SYDNEY: The east coast of Australia welcomed the heaviest drenching in years on Friday (Feb 7), dousing some of the country's most damaging and long-running wildfires and easing a drought that has crippled farming across two states. Sydney alone had seen more than 60 millimetres of rain in the past 24 hours and was forecast to receive up to 360 millimetres more by Monday. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) said on Thursday "they were over the moon" as the total number of active fires across the state fell by 20 in a single day. For the first time in months there were no fire warnings and active fires were down to 42, less than half their peak. Victoria still had 18 bushfire warnings in place, though the rain was steadily making its way down the coast and into the northeast of the state. Yet with the rain came flooding. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issuing multiple warnings for rivers across Queensland and New South Wales. The widespread rains will help ease a drought that has stricken the states since 2017, though the BOM has said it would take an entire year of above average rainfall to actually break the drought. The wet weather has helped douse or slow some wildfires, which have burned through more than 11.7 million hectares of land since September. The prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals. More than 2,500 homes have been destroyed. Some 3,500 kilometres away to the north west, Cyclone Damien was barrelling toward the coast of Western Australia and due to make landfall sometime on Saturday. Destructive wind gusts of up to 150 kilometres per hour could develop overnight on Friday night as the cyclone approaches the coast, and very destructive gusts of up to 230 kilometres per hour were expected at the core on Saturday. The cyclone is set to graze the world's largest iron ore port, Port Hedland, which was already suffering disruptions from quarantine restrictions for the coronavirus afflicting China, its largest customer. Miners Rio Tinto and BHP Group said they were monitoring the situation and making preparations."
Joker's Joaquin Phoenix takes aim at climate apathy with film about dying Earth=07 Feb 2020 12:00AM (Updated: 07 Feb 2020 07:41AM)=Reuters/sr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/joker-joaquin-phoenix-climate-change-film-guardians-of-life-12402380=" Oscar favourite Joaquin Phoenix stars as a medic battling to save a dying planet Earth in a film launched on Thursday (Feb 6), the first in a series of short Hollywood productions aimed at spurring action on climate change. The Joker star teamed up with environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch, a California-based organisation campaigning to protect the Amazon rainforest, to produce the two-minute film Guardians Of Life. Shot in a Los Angeles emergency room, the movie shows doctors attempting to save an unidentified patient whose flatlining vital signs represent the threat posed by climate change, deforestation and fires from Australia to the Amazon. "It's really a call to action," said Phoenix, among the most prominent Hollywood stars to draw attention to the catastrophic damage being caused by human-induced global warming. "People don't realise there's still time, but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We can't wait for governments to solve these problems for us." Founded in Britain, Extinction Rebellion promotes its climate activism through civil disobedience, and Phoenix was himself arrested at a climate change protest organised by fellow Hollywood star Jane Fonda in Washington last month, a few days after winning a Golden Globe for his starring role in Joker. The first in a planned series of 12 short films, Guardians Of Life points to the vital role indigenous people play in protecting habitats, a finding emphasised by scientists studying the million plant and animal species they say risk extinction due to damage caused by industrial society. "This film is very important for us at this moment," said Sonia Guajajara, head of Brazil's largest indigenous umbrella organisation, the Association of Indigenous Peoples. "It demonstrates the artists' engagement in Amazon protection by showing the key role indigenous peoples play in defending the forests, the planet, and life itself." Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine and Oona Chaplin appear alongside Phoenix in the film. It was directed by Shaun Monson and produced with Mobilize Earth, a US not-for-profit organisation set up for the series, and aims to raise money for Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch. "There is still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen," said Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion. "But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real." (Source: Reuters)"
Australia receives a bittersweet bushfires reprieve with floods, cyclone=06 Feb 2020 09:46AM (Updated: 06 Feb 2020 09:52AM)=Reuters/zl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-floods-cyclones-new-south-wales-victoria-12400064=" SYDNEY: Many Australians were experiencing a bittersweet break from the threat of bushfires on Thursday (Feb 6), with heavy rain deluging many areas and a tropical cyclone forecast to hit the country's northwest over the weekend. The Bureau of Meteorology issued severe thunderstorm warnings for the southeast Queensland state, while parts of New South Wales state were inundated during flash floods caused by heavy rainfall that is expected to continue for several days. "There's a great feed of easterly warm, moist air feeding into the system and we're seeing that kick off in the form of rainfall today," BOM forecaster Mike Funnell told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "We are expecting those larger totals and heavier rainfall to come into the northeast coast of NSW and then sort of track slowly southwards." A tropical low off the Kimberley coast in Western Australia state was forecast to develop into a cyclone that could hit land on Saturday. The cooler and wetter weather has helped douse or slow some of the country's most damaging and long-running wildfires, which have burned through more than 11.7 million hectares of land since September. The prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed. Officials, however, have warned the threat was not yet over and that there will likely be weeks more of firefighting ahead. About 60 fires were still burning across NSW and Victoria, the country's most populous states, with around half of those classified as uncontained."

Australian prime minister to feel the political heat as parliament resumes=03 Feb 2020 03:47PM=Reuters/zl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-scott-morrison-parliament-bushfires-sports-funding-12385486=" SYDNEY: Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison will on Tuesday (Feb 4) front parliament for the first time in three months as he seeks to repair his standing with voters angry by his response to the country's bushfire crisis and a scandal over sports funding. Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish his conservative government for ousting its former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018. Less than nine months after what he described as his "miracle" re-election, Morrison is now unpopular with voters and under pressure from opposition Labor lawmakers. "The Labor party will be like a mosquito on a nudist beach, they are so many fleshy issues for them to bite into," said John Hewson, former leader of the Liberal Party, now headed by Morrison. "They will go after him on issues of climate and he's defence of the sports funding. He will be under huge pressure." A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper on Monday showed Morrison's approval rating was at its lowest level since he assumed office, while his government is trailing the Labor party by a margin of 52 per cent to 48 per cent. While Morrison can not be ousted as party leader after changes to Liberal party rules following Turnbull's fall, he will not want poor polling to impact his legislative agenda before the next election that must be held before 2022. Morrison came under fire from voters in December when it was revealed he was on a family holiday in Hawaii as the country's bushfire crisis escalated. When two fire fighters were killed, forcing him to return, his initial inaction and later refusal to link the fires with climate change drew criticism that he lacked leadership at a time of national crisis. The prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares of tinder-dry bushland have been razed. Public anger at Morrison and his government has also been fuelled by an independent audit of public spending which found the government used a A$100 million (US$68.4 million) sport development fund to target votes in marginal electorates ahead of the last election. The Australian National Audit Office said 400 projects received funding, with more than 70 per cent done without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia. When the report was first released Morrison refused to discipline the former sports minister who approved the funding, drawing more voter criticism. Bridget McKenzie, the deputy leader of the Nationals - the junior member of Morrison's conservative coalition - on Sunday resigned after she was ruled to have breached ministerial rules when as sports minister she approved a A$36,000 grant for a shooting club where she was a member."
Canberra heatwave breaks records amid wildfire threat=02 Feb 2020 05:23AM=AFP/nh=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/canberra-heatwave-breaks-records-amid-wildfire-threat-12381484=" SYDNEY: Temperatures in the Australian capital Canberra have set a new monthly record amid an advancing wildfire that has prompted a state of emergency declaration, weather service Meteo France said Sunday (Feb 2). The city declared its first state of emergency in nearly two decades last week in anticipation of a heatwave and predictions that fires could hit the southern suburbs. On Saturday, temperatures in Canberra hit 42.7 degrees Celsius (108.9 degrees Fahrenheit), an all-time high for February that broke a record of 42.2 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) set in 1968, Meteo France weather forecaster Etienne Kapikian said on Twitter. That temperature was also the third-highest recorded in the city in any month, Kapikian said. The new record along with all-time highs in January and December make the 2019-2020 summer the hottest on record, he said. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology did not immediately confirm the records. The state of emergency declared on Thursday is the first in the Australian Capital Territory, which includes Canberra and some surrounding townships, since 2003, when fires destroyed almost 500 homes. The main threat comes from the Orroral Valley fire, which has burned around 18,000 hectares (45,000 acres) of mostly remote bushland. Authorities say the searing heat, accompanied by dry winds, could bring severe bushfire conditions to parts of New South Wales and Victoria. More than 80 fires are still burning across the two states. Temperatures in the New South Wales town of Richmond climbed to 46.8 degrees Celsius (116.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, Kapikian said. Storms are forecast to follow the heatwave, bringing rain that could help dampen fires but also carry the potential for wild weather, including flash flooding. Extreme weather has battered parts of Australia in recent weeks, bringing giant hail, floods and landslides. At least 33 people have died and vast swaths of the country have been burned since September. The months-long crisis has sparked renewed calls for Australia's conservative government to take immediate action on climate change, with street protests urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to reduce the country's reliance on coal. Scientists say the bushfire disaster was likely exacerbated by climate change, coming on the back of a crippling drought that turned forests into a tinderbox and allowed blazes to spread out of control quickly."
Australia's capital Canberra braces as hot, windy conditions fuel bushfires=01 Feb 2020 11:50AM=Reuters/rw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-s-capital-canberra-braces-as-hot-windy-conditions-fuel-12376872=" MELBOURNE: Soaring temperatures and strong winds stoked unpredictable bushfires near Australia's capital city on Saturday, closing a major highway and prompting warnings for some residents that it was too late to evacuate. Skies along the Monaro Highway in the Australian Capital Territory turned orange-red as an uncontrolled blaze ballooned to more than 30,0000ha in size. The territory, home to the country's capital, Canberra, declared a state of emergency on Friday in anticipation of the severely hot and windy conditions that are expected to last through the weekend. It is the area's first declared emergency since 2003 when four people were killed and almost 500 homes destroyed in wildfires.   "Today's extreme heat ... dry conditions and a severe fire danger rating means we can expect another very challenging firefighting day," ACT Emergency Services Agency Commissioner Georgeina Whelan said in a televised briefing in Canberra. "The conditions will potentially become more dangerous and the fire may pose a threat to lives directly in its path." A second major uncontrolled fire was burning slightly further south in the Snowy Monaro region of New South Wales state, the same alpine area where an air tanker crashed on Jan. 22 killing three American firefighters. Temperatures were forecast to top 40°C in several parts of both NSW and the ACT on Saturday, prompting widespread warnings for people to be alert to the potential fire danger. Of the 60 fires alight in NSW, officials had issued emergency level warnings for five in the state's south. In the state of Victoria, where 22 fires were active, one was raised to emergency level status and authorities issued a severe weather warning for intense rainfall that could lead to flash flooding in parts of the state. Australia's devastating and prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million ha (117,000 sq km) of tinder-dry bushland have been razed."
State of emergency declared as bushfire threatens Australian capital=31 Jan 2020 11:15AM (Updated: 31 Jan 2020 11:15AM)=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-canberra-state-of-emergency-12372888=" SYDNEY: Australian officials declared a state of emergency for the capital city of Canberra and surrounding regions on Friday (Jan 31), as soaring temperatures and strong winds threatened to propel a large bushfire beyond the control of firefighters. Andrew Barr, Chief Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), said the decision to declare the first state of emergency since fatal wildfires in 2003 indicated the potential danger over the weekend. Officials said an uncontrolled fire in the ACT's south, on the doorstep of Canberra, had grown to 185 sq km, almost 8 per cent of the territory's land mass. "This fire may become very unpredictable. It may become uncontrollable," Barr told reporters in a televised briefing. "The combination of extreme heat, wind, and a dry landscape will place suburbs in Canberra's south at risk." Australia's federal parliament is located in Canberra, which is also home to several government and independent institutions as well as national museums. Four people died and almost 500 homes were destroyed in the 2003 Canberra fires. The state of emergency declared on Friday will run for 72 hours, giving authorities greater powers to order evacuations, close roads and take control of private property. Heatwave conditions are also expected to sweep through Victoria and New South Wales states over the weekend, where some 80 fires are burning. In neighbouring New Zealand, where smoke from the Australian blazes has turned glaciers brown, firefighters were battling to contain around 25 fires that spread rapidly to cover around 100 hectares on the South Island. Heatwave conditions were also forecast for much of the country over the weekend. Australia has been battling bushfires across its east coast that have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. Around 2,500 homes have been destroyed as more than 11.7 million hectares have been razed. Key events on Friday in the bushfire crisis:"
Heatwave threatens to stoke Australia's deadly bushfires despite containment efforts=31 Jan 2020 07:46AM=Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/heatwave-threatens-to-stoke-australia-s-deadly-bushfires-despite-containment-efforts-12372568=" SYDNEY: Firefighters will struggle to contain deadly fires as soaring temperature and strong winds stoke the threat of more blazes across Australia's east coast, authorities said on Friday (Jan 31). Since September, Australia has been battling bushfires that have killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals, while 2,500 homes as more than 11.7 million hectares across Australia's most populous states has been burned. With temperatures across New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria states set to approach 40 degrees Celsius on Friday, authorities said several fires could spread despite recent efforts by firefighters to remove flammable fuels. "We've done a huge amount of work this week ... but there are some areas that are exposed," Rob Rogers, NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner told Sky News. "The threat is severe over the weekend." Bushfires are common in Australia’s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern hemisphere spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland extremely dry. The crisis has put pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who critics say has not done enough to address the impact of climate change. Keen to dampen public anger, Morrison on Friday pledged funding for emissions reduction projects as part of a AUS$2 billion (£1.04 billion) package to increase gas supplies in NSW. Morrison said the extra gas will stabilise the NSW electricity grid, allowing for greater renewable energy generation. Here are Friday key events in the bushfire crisis: - NSW firefighters were tackling 53 fires. All of the fires were at the lower warning levels. - There are 18 fires burning across Victoria state. Authorities told locals close to one fire to be ready to evacuate. - In South Australia state there are 19 fires, none of which pose an immediate threat to properties."
Heatwave and high winds threaten to rekindle Australian wildfires=30 Jan 2020 09:55AM (Updated: 30 Jan 2020 04:50PM)=Reuters/nc/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-threat-forecast-heat-12369004=" SYDNEY: Large swathes of southeast Australia were bracing on Thursday (Jan 30) for a days-long heatwave that threatens to stoke bushfires that have been burning for months. As firefighters and residents prepared for the heightened danger, the New South Wales (NSW) state government launched a six-month inquiry to examine both the causes of and response to this season's deadly wildfires. "We don't want to waste the opportunity to take on board any recommendations we need to adopt ahead of the bushfire season this year ... as we approach summer of 2021," said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of NSW. NSW state has been one of the hardest hit by bushfires, which started earlier than usual in September. The blazes have burnt out more than 11.7 million hectares (117,000 sq kms) across Australia's most populous states, killing at least 33 people and about 1 billion animals, and destroying 2,500 homes. Fire danger warnings were issued on Thursday for several areas in South Australia state, where temperatures were forecast to exceed 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds were expected to reach 35km (22 miles) per hour. Among them was Kangaroo Island, a popular tourist destination that has already been razed by fires that killed two people. The severe heat and high winds are forecast to hit NSW and Victoria states from Friday threatening to spark new life into some of the 120 fires burning across the three states or create new blazes. Australia's dangerous summer weather has largely been driven by temperature variations in the Indian Ocean, which the country's weather bureau said on Thursday were likely to keep conditions hot and dry until March. Martin Webster, a NSW Rural Fire Service officer, highlighted the strains facing the state's 74,000-strong volunteer brigade as the huge fires continued to burn. "Our local crews have been actively involved in firefighting since August and we are still long way from being out of the woods, so we are talking six or seven months of firefighting," Webster told the Australian Broadcasting Corp."
Tennis: Zverev renews pledge to donate US$2.8 million winner's cheque to bushfire relief==AFP/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/tennis-zverev-renews-pledge-to-donate-us-2-8-million-winner-s-12365078=" MELBOURNE: Alexander Zverev renewed a pledge Wednesday (Jan 29) to donate the A$4.12 million (US$2.83 million) Australian Open winner's cheque to bushfire relief if he lifts the title, after sweeping into the semi-finals. The generous 22-year-old German has already raised US$50,000 by handing over US$10,000 for each match he has won at Melbourne Park, a vow made after his first-round victory. At the same time, he said he would also donate the winner's earnings should he breakthrough for a maiden Grand Slam title "Yes, it is still true. I hope I can make it happen," he told cheering fans on Rod Laver Arena after sweeping past veteran Swiss Stan Wawrinka 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in the quarter-finals. "I made the people of Australia a promise. I will keep that promise if it happens. "Four million Australian dollars would be nice. But there's people that need it... for rebuilding the lives they once knew. "It is much more important that they get that money," he added in an on-court interview with John McEnroe. Fires have ravaged large parts of Australia, leaving 33 people dead and thousands of homes destroyed, with sports stars around the world rallying to support recovery efforts. It was feared that smoke from the blazes could impact the opening Grand Slam of the year after qualifying was hit by thick smog. But rain helped douse some of the fires and the air quality in Melbourne has not affected the tournament. For Zverev to make good on his pledge he will need to first get past either world number one Rafael Nadal or fifth seed Dominic Thiem in the semi-finals. If he can do that, seven-time champion Novak Djokovic or six-time winner Roger Federer await in the final. Zverev's run to the last four in Melbourne is the farthest he has got in the 19 Grand Slams he has played."
Super Rugby adopts air quality policy after bushfires=29 Jan 2020 12:15PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/super-rugby-adopts-air-quality-policy-after-bushfires-12364558=" WELLINGTON: Super Rugby has adopted an air quality policy ahead of Friday's season-opening matches in the wake of the bushfires that have caused havoc across Australia, organisers SANZAAR said. The bushfires have killed 33 people and about 1 billion animals since September, while 2,500 homes and an area the size of Greece have been destroyed. Super Rugby kicks off with New Zealand's Auckland Blues hosting the Waikato Chiefs but it is Friday's second game in Canberra between the ACT Brumbies and Queensland Reds that is of more concern for organisers. The smoke that shrouded Canberra in December, forcing the cancellation of a Twenty20 cricket match and Super Rugby's Brumbies to move their pre-season training to Newcastle for 10 days, has returned this week. "It has been an extraordinary summer in Australia to date and we deeply sympathise with all those individuals and communities who have been impacted by the bush fires," SANZAAR Chief Executive Andy Marinos said in a statement. "Naturally, the continued welfare of our players and indeed spectators is a priority for us should such incidents continue to affect the Australian landscape. "It is therefore prudent of us to put in place these guidelines with our stakeholders." The new policy would take into account particulate matter at the match venue, the Air Quality Index, weather forecasts and other environmental factors at the venue, as well as if players are exhibiting signs, or reporting symptoms, of distress. The decision whether a game goes ahead would be made by a panel of medical staff, match officials, venue operations staff and Super Rugby administrators. Under SANZAAR rules, if conditions are deemed unsafe before kickoff or during the first half and the game is abandoned then the match is declared a draw and the four competition points shared. If a game is abandoned at halftime or during the second half then the result stands. Only two Super Rugby games in the competition's 25-year history have been cancelled. Last year, the Canterbury Crusaders match with the Otago Highlanders was cancelled following a mass shooting in Christchurch. A Crusaders game against the Wellington Hurricanes was also cancelled following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"
Australia leader seeks greater federal powers in emergencies: Report=29 Jan 2020 08:00AM=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-leader-seeks-greater-federal-powers-in-emergencies-12363782=" SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison wants greater federal powers during natural disasters, local media reported on Wednesday (Jan 29), as authorities warned that bushfires ravaging the country for months were now sweeping through a national park outside the capital. In prepared remarks, reported by local newspapers ahead of a speech later in the day, Morrison responded to criticism he was too slow to act when the seriousness of the country's worst bushfire season in a generation became apparent late last year. Attacked by political opponents and media commentators for holidaying in Hawaii while the fires raged, Morrison initially said the country's eight state and territory governments had the main oversight during natural disasters. He later mobilised about 3,000 Australian Defence Force (ADF) reservists to help regional communities affected by the fires. "There is now a clear community expectation that the commonwealth should have the ability to respond in times of national emergencies and disasters, particularly through deployment of our defence forces in circumstances where the life and property of Australians have been assessed to be under threat," the Australian newspaper quoted Morrison as saying, in the prepared text of a speech to be delivered in the capital Canberra on Wednesday. "We must continue to learn from this fire season so we are better prepared for the next one, whether that be the deployment of the ADF, local hazard reduction, access to resources such as aerial firefighting equipment, consistency of disaster recovery arrangements or resilience in the face of a changing climate," the paper quoted him as saying. Morrison's office was not immediately available for comment. Wednesday's scheduled speech comes as a fire of nearly 10,000 hectares was tearing across a national park south of the capital. Authorities have said there was no immediate danger to the city's outer suburbs but have warned of a return to dangerous conditions later in the week, when temperatures are scheduled to remain over 40 degrees Celsius for several days. Bushfires have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals in Australia since September, while 2,500 homes and a wilderness area the size of Greece have been destroyed. New South Wales firefighters were tackling 62 fires. Only one fire is at "watch and act" warning level, meaning there was no immediate danger. The rest are at lower warning levels. In Victoria state, there were 15 warnings in place, none of which was deemed an immediate threat to property. A high pressure weather pattern is set to move across Australia's east coast later this week, bring soaring temperatures over the weekend."
Australia readies for more bushfires with temperatures set to soar=28 Jan 2020 10:02AM=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-more-fire-weather-12360266=" SYDNEY: Australian officials on Tuesday (Jan 28) warned communities in hard-hit eastern states to strengthen bushfire defences as soaring temperatures and strong winds were set to return, threatening to reignite some blazes and start fresh ones. Since September, Australia has been battling bushfires that have killed 33 people and about 1 billion native animals, while 2,500 homes and an area the size of Greece have been destroyed. Firefighters have used several days of cooler, damper weather across much of the continent to try and gain control of more than 100 blazes still burning before the weather turns. "Warm, dry and windy weather is forecast for today. There is a very high fire danger particularly in the central and south east of the state," the New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) said on Twitter. "Worsening conditions are forecast for later the week so prepare now." The RFS said people should clear their properties of any flammable vegetation, while any broken roof tiles should also be repaired to protect houses from airborne embers. As NSW readied for more bushfires, residents in Australia's capital, Canberra woke on Tuesday to thick, hazardous smoke covering the city. Firefighters are battling to contain a fire in Namadgi National Park near the capital and authorities worry the blaze may spread as temperatures are set to top 35 degrees Celsius later on Tuesday. Defence and emergency services personnel were knocking on the doors of homes near the blaze on Tuesday morning, urging residents to be ready to evacuate. NSW firefighters were tackling 54 fires. Only one fire is at "watch and act" warning level, meaning no immediate danger. The rest are at lower warning levels. In Victoria state, there were 35 active blazes, none of which were deemed an immediate threat to property. A high pressure weather pattern is set to move across Australia's east coast later this week, bring soaring temperatures over the weekend. Researchers from the University of Sydney on Tuesday released a report that found just three days of low-level bushfire smoke exposure increased the threat of cardiac arrest, with people over 65 at higher risk."
Half of Australians donated to bushfire appeal: Survey=27 Jan 2020 11:28AM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australians-donate-bushfire-appeal-survey-12354490=" MELBOURNE: One in two Australians have donated money to support bushfire relief efforts, a new survey showed over the weekend, with meteorologists warning more hot and dry weather is to return after a heavy rain respite dampened many of the blazes. The Australian bush has always burned, but this season's fires, which began early, have in the past four months claimed the lives of 33 people, millions of animals and have charred an area nearly the size of Greece. With the fires also destroying thousands of homes and inflicting psychological and physical damage to many, Australians have been increasingly coming together to aid one another as the country looks to rebuilding.   Some 53 per cent of Australians have donated to a bushfire appeal during this season, a survey conducted by the fundraising and marketing consultancy More Strategic in partnership with the Fundraising Institute Australia (FIA) showed over the weekend. Nearly half of the donations went to a collection organised on behalf of a charity, while 14 per cent have donated through Facebook. Estimates on total money collected vary, as donations keep pouring from Australia and abroad, with some Australian media saying hundreds of millions of dollars have come in so far. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday that he will move a motion of condolence at the parliament's first sitting in early February. "These fires have been devastating but through these terrible times we have also witnessed the Australian spirit on display with an outpouring of love, support, courage and generosity," Morrison said in a statement. With more than a week of solid rains in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the three states most affected by the bushfires, the number of blazes has more than halved, but there were still several dozen fires burning, according to fire services. Meteorologists warned on Monday, however, that the cooler conditions may be over. "The reprieve may be short lived with a blast of heat likely late this week in some areas," the Bureau of Meteorology in the New South Wales state said on Twitter."
Golf: Herbert wins Dubai Desert Classic in play-off=27 Jan 2020 02:26AM=AFP/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/golf-herbert-wins-dubai-desert-classic-in-play-off-12351900=" DUBAI: Lucas Herbert celebrated Australia Day with his first title on the European Tour when he beat South Africa's Christiaan Bezuidenhout to win the Dubai Desert Classic on the second play-off hole on Sunday (Jan 26). After hitting his second shot on the first extra hole into the water on the par-5 18th hole, Herbert made a terrific up-and-down for par to halve the hole, and then birdied the same hole a little while later. Bezuidenhout overshot the green with his second and failed to make his up-and-down from there. For Herbert, it was the biggest final-round comeback in the 31-year history of the tournament after he had started the day five shots behind overnight leader Wu Ashun of China. The previous record was held by Tiger Woods who overcame a four-shot deficit in 2008. Both Bezuidenhout and Herbert shot rounds of four-under par 68 in extremely difficult conditions at the Majlis course of Emirates Golf Club and set the clubhouse marker at nine-under par 279. However, none of the leading players after the third round could catch up with the two as gusting winds of 30 miles per hour and more wreaked havoc. Three players -? Dean Burmester of South Africa (72), Tom Lewis of England (74) and Adri Arnaus of Spain (70) ?- were tied third at seven-under par 281. It was the 24-year-old Herbert's 50th appearance on the European Tour and the win is expected to lift him from 223rd in the world rankings to number 77 on Monday. 'PRETTY COOL RUSH' "It feels pretty good. I finished top-10 quite a few times and that was a pretty cool rush, but to win is something else," said Herbert, who had started the day with a bogey. "Just the fact that with everything that's gone on back home (the country's devastating bush fires), if I can bring a little bit of joy to the guys who are struggling back there, yeah, it's real special." The 68s by Herbert and Bezuidenhout were the best round of the day as only three holes played below their par score. "It was brutal out there. That rough was up pretty thick. Those greens were baked. That little bit of rain on the back nine kind of helped, because otherwise, those greens were a lot to deal with," added Herbert. Bezuidenhout was handling the tough conditions extremely well and was bogey-free with five birdies in 17 holes, before making his first and only mistake on the last. After laying up perfectly with his second shot on the par-5 18th, he spun back his wedge third into the water and needed to make a putt from 18 feet to avoid a double bogey. On the other hand, Herbert birdied the 17th after hitting his driver to the green edge on the par-4 hole and then smashed his second shot on to the green on the 18th and two-putted from a long range for another birdie to join Bezuidenhout as the clubhouse leader at nine-under par. Defending champion Bryson DeChambeau, of the USA, was in the mix as he reached the 15th tee at nine-under par. He then proceeded to make four bogeys over the closing stretch to drop down to tied eighth position. Overnight leader Wu carded a final round 77 to finish three behind."

Herbert saved par on the first extra hole after hitting his approach shot into the water, before returning to the same green to roll in the winning birdie. Earlier, Bezuidenhout and Herbert had finished with final rounds of four-under-par 68 as they emerged from way back in the field to finish nine-under overall - two shots clear of England's Tom Lewis, South African Dean Burmester and Spaniard Adri Arnaus. South African Bezuidenhout found the water on the final hole but recovered with a clutch putt for bogey, while Herbert came home with back-to-back birdies. Last year's champion Bryson DeChambeau grabbed a share of the lead with a birdie on the 13th but fell away in windy conditions, finishing with four straight bogeys in a 76. Overnight leader Wu Ashun of China took sixth spot alongside American Kurt Kitayama at six under, finishing a shot ahead of Frenchman Mike Lorenzo-Vera, Scot Robert MacIntyre and DeChambeau. But the day belonged to Herbert, whose victory in his 50th European Tour appearance will move him back into the top 100 of the world rankings. "It's the best thing ever, it's so good," the 24-year-old said. "We've got a bottle of scotch at home to celebrate back in Australia so I can't wait to get into that with the boys." Herbert dedicated his win to those affected by the bushfires in Australia in recent months. "There's some pretty awful stuff happening in Australia right now with the fires... everyone around the world is behind us and hopefully we can keep fighting harder than what I did on that first play-off hole," he added. "That's nothing compared to the firefighters and volunteers that are putting out the fires so I'm sending all my love back home." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Clare Fallon)"
Kangaroo Island is an ecological wonderland; now half of it is burnt and survival hangs in the balance==CNA/jb=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/kangaroo-island-australia-bushfires-ecology-survival-12323578=" KANGAROO ISLAND, Australia: The west end of Kangaroo Island could be another planet. Up to the horizon, a moonscape stretches out, scarred by fire and devoid of life. Strong gusts are hurling white sand and ash across empty roads. There is no sound but the rough howl of the wind. It is a sad oddity in a place normally echoing with song and pulsating with colour. It has been left in a monotone state. The Australian bush is as resilient as landscapes come. And this island has been a refuge, to delicate and unique wildlife and to its people.   But these bushfires have cut Kangaroo Island in half. More than 210,000 hectares have been burnt, including some of its most pristine wilderness. Dozens of homes have succumbed to the flames, roads remain cut, tourists are gone and summer is not over. Survival is everything now. That struggle is playing out hour after hour at Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, the makeshift centre for emergency animal care in the charred bush. Its owner Sam Mitchell thought he could handle about 15 more koalas in addition to the ones he already kept. “And now we’ve seen over 400,” he said.   “We weren’t prepared for it but no one was. We’ve just been going flat out for two weeks and we’ve saved a lot of animals. But it’s not just going to blow over. This will be with us for a long time.” Meantime, animal rescuers have documented finding charred corpses of animals every few metres as they traipsed across a smouldering fireground in search of survivors. The death toll is horrendous.  Those they came across were typically in a desperate state. Now, here is an urgent plea for volunteers to fly to the island to provide food, water and basic care to the animals left out there. Species that exist here and nowhere else on the planet are high on the priority list.   There are only 4,700 people living on Kangaroo Island. Wave after wave of this crisis has fallen over them over the past few weeks. Fatigue is every local’s companion by this point. And still they fear more is to come. The island’s economy is strongly tilted towards agriculture and tourism. With damage done to infrastructure and reputation, both industries face long recoveries. “We could be facing economic collapse if we don’t have people coming through our doors and supporting us. Then people will be letting staff go. And when staff go, they pack up, they leave, they take their skills with them,” said Leeza Irwin, the co-owner of Raptor Domain, a tourist and educational facility showcasing rescued birds of prey and reptiles.   “The things that Kangaroo Island are known for are still here. But for it to be still here, we need everybody to come and see us and we need them to support us,” she said. Jim Geddes returned to see his accommodation buildings at Hanson Bay, overlooking a postcard beach, completely destroyed. At his adjoining wildlife sanctuary, a mass grave holds the bodies of some 800 dead animals. But he is still leaning on small pieces of wonder among the devastation. “We still have 30 to 40 koalas, which are completely unscathed and untouched, sort of living just like they always had,” he said. “I just wish they could tell me where they sheltered during the storm. It’s just a miracle of nature.   “This has been a really tough time but the Australian bush bounces back really, really quickly. There are plenty of green shoots.” The community’s bond has found new strengths during this saga. Out of love for one another and out of necessity. The Western Districts Football Club was known as the “club in the scrub” before the fires surrounded their ground and facilities. As their flag blows in the billowing wind, there is little around them but blackened skeletons of that iconic bushland.   The clubhouse is gone but the support remains. The footy team’s changing rooms have become an emergency hub supporting locals who have lost plenty. “The devastation that has come to the island was just unbelievable,” said Jade Hinton, who is managing the hub. “It’s just been a great place for people to come to, for their wellbeing too, just to be able to offload and talk about how things are going, to receive the support that they so desperately need. “People need to rebuild their lives. They’ve lost everything. There are so many that have not only lost their home, they’ve lost their job. Yeah, it’s tough.”   Amid the cooperation, in the shadows division ripples as frustrations grow and blame gets directed. These are hot times, in emotion and in temperature. In 2019, South Australia experienced its driest year on record - 65 per cent less rain than average. Starving for water, the island became a tinderbox. But even the town’s mayor won’t say climate change is at play here. He doesn’t believe in it - and even former US President Barack Obama felt Michael Pengilly’s social media scorn for daring to suggest so. “Pathetic,” he tweeted.  More green shoots will surely arrive soon. Not soon enough for an island parched of much that it needs to survive."
Bodies of US firefighters retrieved from crash site in Australia=25 Jan 2020 10:04AM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/bodies-of-us-firefighters-retrieved-from-crash-site-in-australia-12330692=" MELBOURNE: The bodies of three US firefighters who died in a plane crash earlier this week in Australia's remote bushland while battling a fierce wildfire have been recovered, the police said on Saturday. "I can confirm that the bodies have been recovered," a New South Wales Police spokesperson told Reuters in an e-mail. "They have been taken for a post mortem examination to confirm ID." Coulson Aviation, the private Canadian firm that employed the trio, named them as US military veterans Captain Ian H McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Montana, First Officer Paul Clyde Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Arizona, and Flight Engineer Rick DeMorgan Jr, 43, of Navarre, Florida. The crash of the C-130 tanker plane on Thursday added to national grief in Australia over bushfires that have since October killed 33 people and millions of animals as well as charred vast swaths of land. Officials said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash of the plane that went down just after it dumped a large load of retardant on a huge wildfire in a national park in the mountains south of Canberra, the Australian capital. The Americans were a part of a multi-national contingency that has been helping Australia to combat the devastating bushfires that have in three months scorched a land area about one-third the size of Germany, razing thousands of homes. There were 57 bush and grass fires burning in New South Wales, 23 of which were yet to be contained as of early Saturday, New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Twitter. Fire conditions have eased in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, three of the states burned badly in the blazes, with severe storms expected to bring heavy rainfall to some firegrounds over the weekend, meteorologists said. Melbourne, where the Australian Open tennis tournament is under way, was expected to have a clear, sunny and warm weekend, but air quality in Canberra has continued to rank in the top 50 most polluted cities in the world."
Australia mourns US firefighters as probe into plane crash begins==Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-mourns-us-firefighters-as-probe-into-plane-crash-12318292=" MELBOURNE: Firefighters in Australia held a minute's silence on Friday (Jan 24) for three US colleagues killed in a plane crash as investigators began scouring the accident site in remote bushland. The premier of New South Wales (NSW) state, where the C-130 Hercules crashed while on a mission to dump retardant on a huge wildfire, ordered that flags on official buildings be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect. "We will forever be indebted to the enormous contribution and indeed the ultimate sacrifice that's been paid as a result of these extraordinary individuals doing a remarkable job," NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at a farewell near Sydney airport for 32 US firefighters who were returning home after weeks on duty on Australia. Fitzsimmons and air safety officials said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash. "We simply don't know the circumstances pertaining to the accident at this stage," Fitzsimmons said. "Appropriate, formal investigations and inquiries are underway." The three crew who died were Ian McBeth, 44, Paul Hudson, 42, and Rick DeMorgan Jr, 43, their employer, Canadian firm Coulson Aviation said in a statement. All three had previously worked for the US military. Two were married and two left behind young children. "We honour the amazing crews who do incredible things in dangerous circumstances supported by world-class operations," Coulson Aviation said in a statement. The company had grounded its other air tankers in Australia immediately after the crash on Thursday but said they would be returning to work "in the very near future". Fitzsimmons earlier said field reports showed there had been a "pretty significant fireball associated with the plane crash", while a spokesman for Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority told Reuters the aircraft went into a valley to drop the retardant and did not emerge. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it would provide a preliminary report in about 30 days, after analysing available recorded data, reviewing weather information and interviewing any witnesses. The owner of the aircraft, Canadian aerial firefighting company Coulson Aviation, was sending a team to help with the investigation. They are due to arrive in Sydney on Saturday morning, Fitzsimmons said. A US National Transportation Safety Board official said the agency plans to have some involvement and will likely send an investigator or two to Australia. There have been two previous crashes involving C-130 Hercules aircraft while fighting wildfires. In a 2002 accident in California, caught on video tape, the wings of the plane folded upward, breaking off the plane before the fuselage rolled and hit the ground upside down, killing all three crew. In 2012, another C-130 crashed in South Dakota, killing four of the six crew, in an accident that was later determined to be weather-related. "Unfortunately, aircraft are one of the riskiest parts of wildland firefighting," said Eric Kennedy, a disaster and emergency management expert at York University in California. Kennedy said there many possible causes for Thursday's crash, but noted that a well-known risk in the C-130 fleet was metal fatigue-induced wing failure. "Reduced visibility, high turbulence, and low flying can all be contributing risk factors for air tanker crashes," Kennedy said in emailed comments. SMOKE HAZE RETURNS The plane crash on Thursday took the death toll for Australia's devastating bushfire season to 32, including eight firefighters. The wildfires have also killed millions of animals, razed thousands of homes and destroyed a land area about one-third the size of Germany since September. Six local volunteer firefighters were injured later on Thursday when a water tanker vehicle rolled when they were battling a blaze in the south coast region of the state. Three were released from hospital on Thursday night, while the other three would be released on Friday, officials said. While fire conditions eased in southeastern Australia on Friday, Sydney was choking on a new smoke haze, blown in by a baking hot wind from the fires burning in the south of the state. The harbourside city was also covered in a layer of terracotta-coloured soil brought in from the west by huge dust storms. In New South Wales, firefighters were tackling 95 blazes, but they were all at the lowest warning levels. In Victoria state, one out of 60 fires was rated at the warning level of "watch and act", meaning there was no immediate danger."
Australia to probe crash that killed three US firefighters=24 Jan 2020 08:29AM (Updated: 24 Jan 2020 09:16AM)=AFP/rw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-probe-crash-killed-three-us-firefighters-12319334=" SYDNEY: Police investigators will join a probe into the crash of a firefighting plane that killed three American crew helping to battle Australia's devastating bushfires, officials said Friday. The Hercules C-130 water-bombing aircraft erupted in a fireball on impact in the Snowy Mountains on Thursday as firefighters raced to tackle another outbreak of the deadly blazes. Hazardous materials specialists were working to secure the crash site before air transport safety investigators can begin sifting through the evidence with police support. Authorities said three men aged 42, 43 and 45 were believed to be on board at the time of the crash, which left no survivors. Their deaths brought the toll in the bushfires to 32 since September, with New South Wales hardest hit in what the state's Emergency Services Minister, David Elliott, called "the darkest summer of the state's history". Flags were being flown at half mast across the state on Friday in their honour. At a farewell for 32 US and Canadian firefighters who arrived in Australia before Christmas to help fight the blazes, New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons paid tribute to the three dead. "We will be forever indebted to the enormous contribution -- indeed the ultimate sacrifice -- that's been paid as a result of these extraordinary individuals doing a remarkable job, as they have done for years now in New South Wales," he said. Canadian firm Coulson Aviation owned the plane and had been contracted to help fight fires in Australia. Representatives from the company were due to arrive in Australia on Saturday, while the families of the victims were also expected to travel to Australia in the coming days. Fitzsimmons said this fire season was proving to be "truly tragic, extended, damaging (and) destructive". Six volunteer firefighters were also seriously injured when a water truck rolled near the fire-threatened town of Batemans Bay, on the state's south coast, on Thursday night. New South Wales Deputy Premier John Barilaro told public broadcaster ABC it was suspected some could be suffering spinal injuries. "You can see clearly it's tough conditions and our volunteers are going beyond the norm to try to protect community and lives," he said. Firefighters had been battling dangerous blazes Thursday, as strong winds and temperatures reaching above 40 degrees Celsius sparked new fires across Australia's southeast before conditions eased Friday. A new heatwave is forecast for next week and could fuel a new flare-up of wildfires. A state memorial service will be held for all fallen firefighters and others killed in the fires at a later date."
Koala bushfire victims start to return home amid wider fears for Australia’s wildlife==CNA/jb=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfires-koalas-wombats-injuries-burns-12302962=" ADELAIDE, Australia: At Paradise Primary School, boxes and boxes of koalas are lined up on the floor of a gymnasium. Volunteers and veterinarians tend to the animals, all victims of damaging bushfires that swept through South Australia in late December. This makeshift emergency triage centre for wounded koalas has been a site of both tears and triumph over the past few weeks. Death has never been far away as the team at Adelaide Koala Rescue (AKR) has responded to hundreds of calls to help animals burnt, displaced and starving as a result of the fires. But for dozens of the koalas left here now, home is calling.  There have been staggering losses to Australia’s wildlife this summer, as bushfires ripped through more than 10 million hectares of land. Experts predict that some 1.25 billion animals, including mammals, birds and reptiles, have been killed nationwide. The number reaches into the trillions when insects and other invertebrates, all essential to delicate ecosystems, are counted. And still, the blazes rage. While the casualty rates and long term impact on the environment are hard to fathom, those working tirelessly to save and recuperate the survivors have been left holding onto small positives. For AKR, it comes in the form of paper signs at the entrance to their triage centre. On it is listed the names of all of the koalas who have successfully “graduated” back to the wild. Each of them - like Spud and Janet and Alice Cooper - is a “cause for celebration”, according to director Jane Brister.   “I think more than anything, it’s important for the morale for our volunteers,” she said. “It’s been a really traumatic time for a lot of the team members, especially the ones that go out in the field. I’ve certainly seen things that I can’t unsee.” Brister estimates that AKR has retrieved more than 300 koalas from scorched areas within the past three weeks, and cared for up to 120 wild animals at any one time. Each animal has different medical treatment needs - from burnt paws to singed ears and dehydration - but all of them require housing, food and a bit of love, during what is a traumatic and confusing period. “What people love about them the most and what upsets people the most when it comes to bushfires is their innocence and their vulnerability. They can’t fly away, they can’t run away,” she said.   “They’re stuck there up a tree and they’re really defenceless. They have to rely on us to fight for them, to fight for their habitat and I think that’s in part what makes them so endearing.” Despite the easing of the worst fire conditions in South Australia, here and right across bushfire affected areas, finding relocation refuges for rehabilitated or dislocated wildlife is proving to be a difficult challenge. For those survivors hanging on in burnt out areas, the situation is desperate too.   ‘THEY’RE ALL BASICALLY GONE’ In Majors Creek, a small rural community close to Canberra, Bill Waterhouse and his wife Lesley run a wombat refuge, which has quickly transformed into a rescue operation for a menagerie of wildlife. “This morning a little baby wombat was brought to us, I was called out for a kangaroo hanging in a fence and on the way home I brought home a magpie,” Waterhouse said.  The couple have been responding to rescue requests since bushfires reared up in their area in early December. The danger has not passed and they constantly live in fear of another evacuation from their property, which is home to several injured animals.   “We feel like we’re under siege, personally here, but we also feel like all the animals we’ve cared about for so many years are now being burnt to death and now our release sites and their carers are under attack,” he said. “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t feeling a sense of anguish about it.” Local areas that used to be safe havens for the animals they released back into the wild are now affected by fire. There are few safe places left. On the back of donations, Waterhouse is attempting to mobilise local landowners to try and provide much needed food on the edges of the fireground where wild animals are coming to scavenge. But he has been left saddened by the lack of animals that appear to be in need of help. “There have been very few animals brought to us, burnt or not. In general, with the amount of damage that’s taken place, we were expecting many more but it’s been so hot and so devastating that they’re all basically gone,” he said.   “We think the animals are increasingly going to be hungry, they’ll be desperate. There’s no flowers out there, there are no leaves, there are no nests. “The canopy, if it wasn’t burnt, it was scorched. You really notice the silence. The habitat’s had it. There’s pockets left but the fire is indiscriminate. I think it’s just too late for the vast majority. Lesley paces through the couple’s home with a tiny baby wombat tucked into her chest. With electricity still out in the area, the heat pads used to keep the small creatures warm are not working. Little Jack, as he has been dubbed, was found in the pouch of his dead mother, who had been struck by a car, a common accident during this period of prolonged drought and fire.   “The nature of the road is it's warm and water runs off it. So there’s almost always a little bit of greenery on the roadside and animals are drawn to it,” Waterhouse said. “He’s a little pinkie and has no fur yet. He’s the size of a sweet potato with little legs and wriggly bits. It has a very good chance of surviving all the way through. It’s a two year program for him.” Waterhouse and other rescuers are bracing for the long haul care of wildlife amid the widespread habitat destruction. But while koalas, wombats and other generalist Australian species will inevitably bounce back, there are greater fears that lesser known, critically threatened species may have already been lost.   FACING EXTINCTION Analysis by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy shows that 49 threatened species have had more than 80 per cent of their likely or known distribution area affected by fire. A further 65 species have had at least half of their habitats burnt. “If the habitat of those species is removed, then there are real fears for whether they can persist. These would be species extinctions, things that occur here uniquely that won’t occur anymore,” said Chris Dickman, a professor of ecology at the University of Sydney. “It’s clearly a really emotional time for anyone associated with the native fauna. It’s awful to see the pictures and it’s awful to know there’s a whole lot more behind them,” he added. Prof Dickman says while iconic, charismatic animals are important for raising awareness about the damage to natural environments, there are many, many others that are essential to ecosystem balance that have suffered major losses.   “It may be ecologically important species that carry out functions like pollination or moving seeds around in the forest environment, or are important because they move fungal spores, or digging the topsoil. If these are lost, then it means the ability of the forest ecosystem to regenerate in the future will be slowed down or compromised,” he said. But the Australian bush is known to be resilient and he says in some areas, especially if rain has fallen, the recovery of habitats could be “rapid”. The federal government has pledged A$50 million (US$34m) for a Wildlife and Habitat Recovery Package that will be used to try to prevent species extinction and enable the work of local wildlife rescuers. But opposition figures, like Senator Mehreen Faruqi from the Australian Greens, says that money “is just a drop in the ocean”. “Really what we need at this time is an open chequebook from the government because that is the only thing that will ensure the survival of our species and our native species into the future,” she said. “Wildlife carers have been working around the clock to save the animals, to protect the animals and to rehabilitate animals but you know this is really expensive work, it is time consuming work and it is absolutely emotionally draining work.”   The tired eyes of the volunteers at the koala triage centre are testament to the fatigue and stress inflicted upon them these past weeks. But for each koala carried out in their hamper - their name added to the list on the door - destined for a return to a eucalyptus tree somewhere in the Adelaide Hills, a feeling of optimism infectiously hovers over the gym. It comes even though there is a deep understanding that thousands of others have died. It is the small positives that matter right now."

Australia's bushfire danger returns as Sydney faces scorching heat=23 Jan 2020 07:14AM (Updated: 23 Jan 2020 10:54AM)=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-bushfire-fire-forecast-temperature-12306956=" MELBOURNE: Soaring temperatures and strong winds stoked bushfires in Australia's southeast on Thursday (Jan 23), with Sydney forecast to hit 41 degrees Celsius following a few days of reprieve. A fire in the Snowy Mountains region and one in the Bega Valley on the south coast of New South Wales (NSW) state both flared up, with emergency authorities warning residents to get out if they did not plan to defend their properties. "Fire dangers are just starting to peak, and we're in for a long afternoon and night across many areas of NSW," the state's Rural Fire Service said on its Twitter account. The Bureau of Meteorology warned that "damaging winds" were driving up fire dangers in some regions, while the country's biggest city was again forecast to wallow in hazardous air quality levels under smoke palls from some 90 blazes burning across the state. Firefighters in New South Wales were tackling 79 blazes on Thursday, all at the lowest warning level, while air quality in the country's biggest city, Sydney, was forecast to drop to poor. In Victoria there were 18 blazes, with one of those, in the state's northeast, at the "watch and act" warning level. Sydney was set for a hot and windy day, with a high temperature of 41 degrees Celsius, while the capital Canberra was forecast to hit 33 degrees Celsius, facing windy conditions and dust haze, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Heavy rain in Melbourne doused any threat of smoke haze hitting players at the Australian Open tennis tournament, with air quality rated as good. Last week, a player collapsed in a coughing fit from bushfire smoke during qualifying rounds at the tournament. Since September, hundreds of wildfires in Australia have killed 29 people as well as an estimated 1 billion native animals, while incinerating 2,500 homes and a total area of bushland one-third the size of Germany. A Reuters analysis shows that Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes. The disaster hit the Christmas and summer holiday season, emptying out caravan parks and hotels, devastating peak earnings for businesses dependent on domestic and foreign tourists. The Australian Tourism Industry Council estimated the revenue loss industry-wide at A$2 billion (US$1.4 billion), including forward sales and the physical damage to tourism facilities across regions ravaged by bushfires. "Whatever the numbers ultimately land at, it's had a significant impact," said Simon Westaway, executive director of the council, which represents small and medium-sized tourism businesses. Cancellation rates hit 100% in fire-affected areas while tourist facilities even in areas not affected by fires were hit with cancellation rates of around 60%, and there is evidence of international booking cancellations too, he said. "People see a state of emergency and don't know if they'll be able to get in or out," Westaway told Reuters. "This contagion has really swept across the industry.""
Removing hazards as important as reducing emissions: Australian PM Morrison==Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/removing-hazards-as-important-as-reducing-emissions-australian-12299086=" SYDNEY: Prime Minister Scott Morrison said removing flammable vegetation is as important as reducing emissions if Australia is to prevent future bushfires, comments that are likely to stoke public anger. Morrison is under intense pressure for his government's handing of a bushfire crisis that has killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares of wilderness - an area one-third the size of Germany. The scores of fires follow three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change, but Morrison said late on Tuesday (Jan 21) that his critics are too focussed on carbon emissions. "Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season," Morrison told Sky News Australia. Australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants, and Morrison is a firm supporter of the industry. Morrison's comments came as Australian authorities braced for a return of soaring temperatures and strong winds - conditions that firefighters fear will fan dozens of blazes still burning. Temperatures in Victoria state are expected to top more than 32 degrees Celsius, leading officials to declare "extreme fire danger" in some areas. Australia's most populous state, New South Wales has enjoyed several days of cooler weather in recent days, but temperatures on Thursday will hit 40 degrees C, the country's weather bureau said. Sydney and Melbourne have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has resulted in air quality ratings among the worst in the world. Here are today's key events in the bushfire crisis: - As of Wednesday, 79 fires were burning across New South Wales, none above the lowest warning level. There were 25 emergency warnings in Victoria. - Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes, a new Reuters analysis shows. - Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott downplayed the link between the bushfires and climate change in a speech in Washington. - The Australian Open tennis tournament continues in Melbourne. The city's air quality was rated as "good", according to the Air Quality Index, having been "hazardous" less than a week earlier."

In forest monastery, Buddhist abbot faces Australia bushfire with a smile=21 Jan 2020 06:57PM (Updated: 21 Jan 2020 06:59PM)=Reuters/zl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-fires-new-south-wales-buddhist-monastery-sunnataram-12296428=" BUNDANOON, Australia: Buddhist monk Phra Mana helped build his bush monastery with his bare hands three decades ago, but when Australia's worst wildfires in generations threatened to destroy it he stood up to fate with a smile. An inferno ripped through the forest surrounding the Sunnataram Monastery in New South Wales two weeks ago and, after being evacuated, he and his fellow monks could do nothing but pray. "I have never seen branches behave like this in the past 30 years," the Bangkok-born abbot said, describing how dry the land was. "So when the heat came, it just burnt so quick." This season's bushfires have razed an area equivalent to half of the UK, killed millions of animals, devastated rural communities and cost farmers and vintners their livelihoods.   At the monastery, which around 50 to 60 volunteer firefighters were dispatched to defend, only a few buildings and water tanks were lost. True to his religion, Phra Mana has been able to accept the damage with equanimity. "Wildfires are normal in Australia's bushland," the 56-year-old said as he strolled around the scorched compound in orange robes. "As long as our faith and morale remain strong, we are prepared to face it." The Buddha statues gracing the compound still stand, and now the monks have added a message spelling out "Thank you Firey", addressed to the firefighters. But the monastery remains under threat as a nearby forest continues to smoulder. "We are prepared. At the same time, we accept," Phra Mana said."
Australian bushfires scathe sanctuary for rare bee species===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australian-bushfires-scathe-sanctuary-for-rare-bee-species-12295766=" KANGAROO ISLAND, Australia: Bees swarm around Peter Davis as he unloads his precious, buzzing cargo into their new home in a part of South Australia's Kangaroo Island that was not devastated by recent bushfires. After losing almost half of his 1,200 hives of Ligurian bees to the blazes on the island, Davis hopes relocating the remainder to unburnt forest and a food supply of eucalypt sugar gums will save them.   Kangaroo Island, about 15,000km away from the Ligurian bees' ancestral home of Italy, is believed to host the world's last genetically pure population of the species. The bees were imported to South Australia in 1885 and officials banned the introduction of any other bee species or honey since, making it a sanctuary for Ligurian bees. Italy's pure stock of the bees was wiped out due to interbreeding and disease. Bushfires burnt a third of Kangaroo Island over New Year, killing two people and destroying an estimated quarter of the island's 4,000 Ligurian hives as well as the eucalypts that feed that the bees. "The main tree for food at this time of the year is the Sugar Gum, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, that grows all along the North Coast which has been devastated by fire," another Kangaroo Island Ligurian honey producer, David Clifford, told Reuters. "So we are not going to get a honey supply from that this year and it will take 15 years for it to recover."     While Clifford's bees escaped the flames, he said the insects appeared "very disorientated" and "more aggressive" than usual after they were relocated. Davis said the destruction has lost him about 20 tonnes of honey for this season alone and cost him an estimated A$500,000 (US$340,000) including lost production from the surviving hives. Ligurian honey is used to make a range of high-end products including hand creams and candles.   Davis was only able to start moving his hives to a safer home this week, having spent the last few weeks fighting fires. "We have been trying to protect neighbours, trying to protect houses, livestock," he said. Davis urged the government to lift restrictions on the island that ban farmers from reducing fuel loads in bushland areas through preemptive burning. "We wouldn't have lost farms and houses like we have if we had been allowed to burn and use fire as a management tool," he said."
Weather 'merry-go-round' poses new risks for fire-ravaged Australia==AFP/aa=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-fires-weather-poses-new-risks-for-firefighters-12295478=" SYDNEY: A "merry-go-round" of extreme weather has been hampering efforts by firefighters in Australia to tackle unprecedented bushfires that have killed at least 29 people and devastated vast swathes of the country. Parts of the country welcomed heavy rainfall overnight, but authorities warned Tuesday (Jan 21) that storms were bringing added complications, and the fire-danger risk could be elevated in the coming days. "It has been a merry-go-round of weather over the last few days," the Bureau of Meteorology's Kevin Parkin said. "We have gone from fires and storms and floods, and giant hail - the size of limes ... producing widespread damage - to fire danger escalating on our doorstep," the senior meteorologist added. The country has suffered a collision of extreme climate events in the past week, with storms, lightning, thunder and hail battering areas in the fire-hit east. The bushfire season has been made worse by climate change, experts say. Victoria state experienced bursts of intense rain over the past 48 hours that helped to contain long-running blazes in some areas, but landslides, fallen trees and lightning strikes have hampered recovery efforts. The temperature in Victoria is set to climb into the mid-30 degrees Celsius range on Wednesday amid fierce winds, prompting extreme weather warnings in the western parts of the state, where authorities say "new start" fires will be difficult to contain. "New starts in unprepared communities are the biggest risk," Victoria Country Fire Authority chief officer Steve Warrington told media. "If communities are not prepared for fire - whether they live or die, whether their property is saved or not saved - is very much dependent on decisions people make right now." A change is expected to bring more rain to the state late Wednesday. Further north in New South Wales state, heavy rains have also been welcomed in some areas but in others it has left fire-ravaged areas too damp to undertake preventative controlled burns. Authorities there are bracing for elevated fire danger on Thursday, when temperatures in parts of the state will tip above 40 degrees Celsius."
5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.
