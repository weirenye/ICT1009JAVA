Climate change could make premiums unaffordable: QBE Insurance,17 Feb 2020 01:36PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-could-make-premiums-unaffordable--qbe-insurance-12441584," SYDNEY: Australia's QBE Insurance Group said on Monday climate change could make some premiums unaffordable, especially for customers exposed to extreme weather events, and was a material risk"" for its operations across the globe. During 2019, QBE's net Australia-Pacific cost of catastrophe claims jumped to US$193 million from US$106 million the year before, led by unprecedented floods in Australia's north east coast and horrendous bushfires across the country's south east. The insurer said it has started to adjust its catastrophe models to factor in the expected impacts of climate change until 2100, and would assess the impact on its weather-related exposures from emissions and temperatures. In the short-term, QBE would manage higher claims by considering event frequency and severity in its capital planning and will deploy a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program, it said. Over the long-term, it expected the physical impacts of climate change ""will result in our customers seeking increased insurance for the protection of their assets and the services they provide."" ""This may cause insurance premiums to become unaffordable, especially for customers in areas more exposed to weather-related events, potentially resulting in a loss of revenue."" Insurers and banks are also facing stricter regulatory scrutiny over their response to global warming, with shareholders expecting better disclosures and transparency on climate-related risks. In its annual climate disclosure, QBE said it plans to phase out all direct insurance services for thermal coal customers by 2030, in an effort to cut emissions responsible for rising global temperatures. It is also committed to shunning direct insurance services for new thermal coal mines, power stations or thermal coal transport infrastructure. Globally, the economic costs from natural disasters have exceeded the 30?year average for seven of the last 10 years, while the number of extreme weather events globally has tripled since the 1980s, QBE CEO Pat Regan said in the company's annual report.

UN's Guterres calls for 'transformational change' on climate,17 Feb 2020 01:46AM,AFP/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/un-s-guterres-calls-for--transformational-change--on-climate-12440330," ISLAMABAD: Governments must deliver decisive actions and transformational change"" to combat global warming, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday (Feb 16), blasting a recent climate summit in Madrid. The so-called COP25 climate talks in the Spanish capital in December were supposed to build on breakthrough promises made at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. Instead, governments equivocated and observers decried their response as inadequate and unambitious. ""Our planet is burning but too many decision makers continue to fiddle,"" Guterres said in a speech he delivered in Islamabad. ""The only answer is decisive climate action ... Gradual approaches are no longer enough."" A United Nations panel concluded late in 2018 that avoiding global climate chaos will require a major transformation of society and the world economy. The landmark report said global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030, and reach ""net zero"" by 2050, to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the safe cap set as a goal in the Paris accord. Guterres said that at the next climate conference, the COP26 in Glasgow later this year, ""governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition."" Guterres said rich countries should lead the way, including by ending ""perverse"" fossil fuel subsidies. Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to intensify their efforts. The summit was at times close to collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests. Guterres credited Pakistan for banning plastic bags in the capital Islamabad and for a large tree-planting programme. Guterres is in Pakistan for a three-day visit that will include his attendance at a conference on Pakistan's hosting of Afghan refugees for 40 years. Pakistan is one of the largest refugee-hosting nations in the world, home to an estimated 2.4 million registered and undocumented people who have fled Afghanistan, some as far back as the Soviet invasion of 1979. Many live in camps, while others have built lives for themselves in Pakistan's cities, paying rent and contributing to the economy. Guterres said the ""preferred, durable solution for the refugees has always been one-time repatriation with safety and dignity to the country of origin""."""
Antarctica registers record temperature of over 20 degrees Celsius,14 Feb 2020 08:17AM (Updated: 14 Feb 2020 08:38AM),AFP,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctica-registers-record-temperature-of-over-20-degrees-12434124," SAO PAULO: Scientists in Antarctica have recorded a new record temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius, breaking the barrier of 20 degrees for the first time on the continent, a researcher said on Thursday (Feb 13). We'd never seen a temperature this high in Antarctica,"" Brazilian scientist Carlos Schaefer told AFP. He cautioned that the reading, taken at a monitoring station on an island off the continent's northern tip on Feb 9, ""has no meaning in terms of a climate-change trend"", because it is a one-off temperature and not part of a long-term data set. But news that the icy continent is now recording temperatures in the relatively balmy twenties is likely to further fuel fears about the warming of the planet. The reading was taken at Seymour Island, part of a chain off the peninsula that curves out from the northern tip of Antarctica. The island is home to Argentina's Marambio research base. Schaefer, a soil scientist, said the reading was taken as part of a 20-year-old research project on the impact of climate change on the region's permafrost. The previous high was in the 19s, he said. ""We can't use this to anticipate climatic changes in the future. It's a data point,"" he said. ""It's simply a signal that something different is happening in that area."" Still, he added, a temperature that high had never been registered in Antarctica. Accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially ice sheets in Antarctica is helping drive sea level rises, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations. The news came a week after Argentina's National Meteorological Service recorded the hottest day on record for Argentine Antarctica: 18.3 degrees Celsius at midday at the Esperanza base, located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on Mar 24, 2015, it said. It has been recording Antarctic temperatures since 1961. The past decade has been the hottest on record, the United Nations said last month, with 2019 the second-hottest year ever, after 2016. And 2020 looks set to continue the trend: Last month was the hottest January on record."""
"Japan needs to apologise more, China needs to say thank you more, says famed prof",13 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 13 Feb 2020 09:07AM),CNA/dp,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/japan-apologise-china-say-thank-you-us-harvard-prof-ezra-vogel-12429600," SINGAPORE: He has spent six decades studying China and Japan, a time span that is only 15 years shy of the end of World War II. In that time, the old wounds of Japanese war atrocities in China have yet to heal. And the question of whether Japan needs to apologise in the way Germany has is never far away. Ezra Vogel, the famed 89-year scholar and Harvard University emeritus professor of social sciences, does not think it would change China’s basic foreign policy considerations. But he agrees that Japan needs “to apologise more”. He also thinks China needs “to say thank you more” — because the Japanese became major contributors of foreign aid to the Chinese after they signed their Treaty of Peace and Friendship.   “The Japanese feel that ... (they) were very generous, after 1978, in helping China. They were giving more aid, more technological assistance, to China than any other country,” he says. “That was given instead of reparations, and the Chinese leaders acknowledged privately at the time that that’s what the meaning was. But the Chinese (leaders) haven’t done so much publicly, and many Chinese are completely unaware of that.” Fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, he has produced bestsellers like Japan As Number One and an authoritative, 900-page tome on Deng Xiaoping. He has even been criticised for being an unabashed admirer of Tokyo and Beijing. For the record, he says he is not an East Asian apologist. Few in the West, however, know those countries better.   And ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan in April — his first and one that experts say is a remarkable warming of bilateral relations — Prof Vogel gives his take on their relationship and also on Sino-American ties. That includes the question of whether Beijing is trying to tug Japan out of Washington’s grasp by cosying up to Tokyo. BETTER TIES LIKELY, BUT NOT BFFs Just a few years ago, China and Japan had a bitter territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. And although Prof Vogel reckons that relations are likely to improve now, he doubts that the Japanese will “feel comfortable being real friends”. “They saw the pictures of Japanese businesses being trashed on television (and of) Chinese planes and ships ... near the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands (in 2013),” he cites. “They look at the movies of WWII, which the Japanese have seen on television from China ... And (they’re) worried that if Chinese domestic problems should get very serious ... it would be quite popular in China to become anti-Japanese again.”   If they would “put in their textbooks more about the horrors they’ve done”, and be more apologetic, he thinks it would make them less vulnerable to Chinese criticism. “When things are tense, China can always pull out the lack of apology to create problems with Japan,” he notes. Many younger Japanese, however, are “tired” of hearing the same old thing. “They say, ‘Why should I apologise for things that happened before I was born?’ And they say, ‘We’ve apologised already. Why’s China pushing us?’” says the professor. “The Japanese know they did bad things in WWII. They realise a lot of countries have done bad things. And they want to improve relations. But they don’t feel that they’re uniquely bad people.”   Mr Xi’s current overtures to Japan come not only a few years after bilateral tensions had been heightened, but also a decade after China overtook Japan as the world’s second-largest economy. That has since meant a “readjustment” of their relationship. “(The Chinese) feel that they’re now in a strong position, that the power they worry about isn’t Japan but the US,” says Prof Vogel. And because China is Japan’s largest trading partner, and Japan is China’s second-largest trading partner after the US, “there’s a very deep interlinkage”. So he thinks an improvement in ties is the likely outcome in April. “The Japanese have a slogan: That the economics between China and Japan are hot, and the politics are cold. I think the politics can become lukewarm,” he adds. “They can calm things down and have better working relationships.”   But they do not “feel confident that they can rely on China to remain friends over a long period” — even if, as some commentators say, Mr Xi is attempting to slowly move Japan away from the US. “If I were Japanese and thinking where my dangers are coming from in the future, I don’t think I’d worry about what the US would do to me. But I’d worry about what the Chinese might do,” says Prof Vogel. “There’s no way the Japanese military budget can compare with China’s in future. In that situation, I think the Japanese still feel that if there were some kind of emergency or difficult issue, they’d want to rely on the US.” And that means keeping a deep defence relationship with the US.   NO CONSENSUS ON CHINA China’s economy is also poised to surpass that of the US — in the next 10 years, say some forecasters. But the problem with their relationship “is much deeper and is going to be harder to resolve”, says Prof Vogel. “(The US) feels that it’s the strongest power in the world. And (there are) those who feel it’s their responsibility to defend our country against any other country, especially one that’s communist, authoritarian and doesn’t respect human rights,” he adds. “The American people feel that this is a very different kind of country ... particularly since China has been advancing and building little islands in the South China Sea.” One of the big questions now is whether there will be a single, integrated global economy, or a split between the Chinese and US economies. The signs are ominous. “Many of the American companies that felt they were working with China quite well feel that they’re no longer as welcome, and that the Chinese government helps (Chinese) firms and makes things very difficult,” says Prof Vogel. “Google can’t operate in China the way it operates in the US. So there’s a feeling in America that (the Chinese) haven’t played by the same kind of rules.”   According to him, however, many of those who study China feel that the Chinese “have done far more to adapt”, and that the mood in Washington is “overblown”. There are far more people in China we can work with, and we feel that we have to work with them in a much more positive way — that if we treat them like an enemy, they can become an enemy. This view of his had prompted him, together with a group of diplomats and other academics, to write an open letter to US President Donald Trump last year, titled China Is Not The Enemy. This came about a year after an “influential article” in the Foreign Affairs magazine said engagement has not worked, which seemed to embody a Washington consensus that China “was something to worry about” and unite against.   Although there are not only Republicans, but also “a lot of Democrats who believe that”, Prof Vogel argues that a fair portion of Americans do not share that sentiment. Even the friends he grew up with in a small town in the Midwest “have different ideas about China”. “The anti-Chinese mood is much stronger in Washington than it is in America as a whole,” he says. “There’s a kind of frustration on the one hand and ... political opportunism, on the other hand, of congressmen and some people in Washington who hope to get jobs in future administrations (and) find it in their interests to be very tough on China.” Those who are like him, however, believe that China, the US and the world “would be better served by finding ways in which we can work with each other”. “There are many of us who hope that we can put America on a better path, but we don’t know (if we can),” he says.

Britain's COP26 climate talks 'can't fail': UK's energy minister,12 Feb 2020 11:36PM,AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/britain-s-cop26-climate-talks-can-t-fail-uk-s-energy-minister-12428378," PARIS: The world can't afford for crunch climate talks this year to fail, Britain's energy minister said Wednesday (Feb 12), despite the government not having named a leader for the summit starting in November. Speaking at an International Energy Agency (IEA) event in Paris, Kwasi Kwarteng said that the COP26 climate negotiations would be the top international priority"" for his government despite it occurring just weeks before the Brexit negotiation period is due to expire. ""We can't guarantee success,"" Kwarteng told country and industry representatives at the IEA. ""What I can commit to is that this is absolutely our number one priority as a government. ""I'm confident it will be a success because we really can't afford it to be a failure, not just on a global level. It's also on a national level given where we are with Brexit and other issues,"" Kwarteng added. The COP26 talks in November are the final negotiating session before the landmark 2015 Paris climate deal goes into effect. The accord saw nations pledge to limit global temperature rises to ""well-below"" two degrees Celsius and to work towards a safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius. To do so greenhouse gas emissions need to fall sharply - 7.6 per cent annually by 2030, according to the latest United Nations estimate. The IEA said Tuesday that emissions from energy, which account for the majority of manmade carbon pollution, had flatlined in 2019 after two successive annual increases. ""2019 is potentially an inflexion point but we have to work very hard to ensure it represents a peak number and not simply a staging post to even more emissions,"" said Kwarteng. He was speaking several days after Britain's original choice for COP26 president, former energy minister Claire O'Neill, was removed from the role. She responded with scathing criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet's handling of preparations. In a letter to Johnson leaked to the Financial Times, she warned: ""We are miles off track. ""You promised to 'lead from the front' and asked me what was needed 'money, people, just tell us!'. Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met."" O'Neill said that a COP26 planning sub-committee had not met once in the months since she was appointed, and told the BBC she believed Johnson ""really doesn't understand"" climate change. With just 1C of warming above pre-industrial levels so far, the world is already experiencing record heatwaves, wildfires and storm surges made worse by rising seas. The COP26 in Glasgow is the last chance for countries to accelerate their plans for voluntary emissions cuts. Current pledges have Earth on course to warm more than 3 degrees Celcius by 2100."""
BP boss Looney 'reinvents' oil giant with zero carbon goal,12 Feb 2020 11:31PM (Updated: 12 Feb 2020 11:35PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/bp-boss-looney--reinvents--oil-giant-with-zero-carbon-goal-12428396," LONDON: BP plans deep cuts to its carbon emissions by 2050, setting one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets, as part of the biggest overhaul in the company's 111-year history by new chief executive Bernard Looney. The targets set out by Looney on Wednesday put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Equinor and all of the U.S. oil majors. We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations of us,"" he said in his first major speech as CEO. ""We need to reinvent BP,"" he said earlier in a statement. BP did not specify how it intends to reach its 2050 targets to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, which include diesel or petrol. Smaller Spanish rival Repsol has set similar net zero carbon targets for the oil products it sells, also known as Scope 3, at a cost of more than US$5 billion. This does not include emissions from products it markets but which were produced by other groups, Repsol said. The huge scale of BP's operations puts its aims at the vanguard in oil and gas. BP has tried reinventing itself before. A pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s ended with huge losses. Since then, the world's top oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. ""The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner,"" Looney added. Shares in BP were up 1.3per cent at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January. BP's absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets but does not produce itself. This is a uniquely structured target for oil majors, which, apart from Repsol, have not set any absolute reduction targets for any of its Scope 3 emissions. BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut its emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. A spokesman said near-term plans would be published by a September investor day. One way of reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets is to offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology which is not yet used at a commercial scale. U.S. groups such as Exxon , Chevron and ConocoPhillips are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. (Graphic: Oil majors&apos; carbon emissions png - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QEMZ7NW/eikon.png) Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. Greenpeace said BP's plan left many questions unanswered. ""How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?,"" Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, said. 'NEW EXPECTATIONS' BP will set ""new expectations"" for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit them if they are not aligned. Last year, BP invested around US$500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of US$15.2 billion in 2019. In one of its biggest-ever changes, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit. ""We need to become more integrated and more focused,"" Looney said. A new production and operations unit, which include oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal, while innovation and engineering will be led by David Eyton.

Shareholder activists test JPMorgan's Dimon on climate proposals,12 Feb 2020 11:15PM (Updated: 12 Feb 2020 11:15PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/shareholder-activists-test-jpmorgan-s-dimon-on-climate-proposals-12428330," BOSTON/NEW YORK: Shareholder activists focused on climate issues vowed to press proxy battles with JPMorgan Chase & Co after getting a cold reception from the top Wall Street bank, even though Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has vowed to protect the environment. Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending. JPMorgan's position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday. They're not walking their talk,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview. She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency's website, JPMorgan argued that her group's request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to ""micromanage"" the company. ""I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there’s no way you can talk to us about anything,"" Fugere said. JPMorgan representatives did not immediately comment. Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also targeted other banks and energy companies with climate proposals this year and hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc to put more focus on environmental issues. Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks. Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a ""statement of corporate purpose,"" arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment.

Pope dismisses proposal to ordain married men as priests in Amazon,12 Feb 2020 07:20PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-dismisses-proposal-to-ordain-married-men-as-priests-in-amazon-12427450," VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, in one of the most significant decisions of his papacy, on Wednesday (Feb 12) dismissed a proposal to allow some married men to be ordained in the Amazon region to ease an acute scarcity of priests. The recommendation, put forward by Latin American bishops last year, had alarmed conservatives in the deeply polarised 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, who feared it could lead to a change in the centuries-old commitment to celibacy among priests. Francis delivered his response in an Apostolic Exhortation, three months after the proposal passed by 128 votes to 41 at a contentious Vatican assembly, or synod, of Roman Catholic bishops. Apostolic Exhortations are used to instruct and encourage the Catholic faithful but do not define Church doctrine. Wednesday's 32-page document did not even mention the proposal, which was for older married deacons who are proven leaders of remote Catholic communities and have stable families to be ordained as priests. Conservatives balked, fearing that even a circumscribed change would be a slippery slope leading to a married priesthood throughout the Church. They branded a pre-synod working document as heretical. In what some viewed as a strategically timed appeal to Francis not to approve the Amazon proposal, a book published last month by Church conservatives defended the tradition of priestly celibacy. From the Depths of Our Hearts"" was co-authored by Cardinal Robert Sarah and Former Pope Benedict, though Francis' predecessor subsequently disassociated himself from the project. Vatican officials said the pope completed the document on Dec. 27, before the book controversy, and handed it in for translations. They said no changes were made after that. In the Exhortation, the 82-year-old Argentine pope wrote, new ways must be found to encourage more priests to work in the remote region, and allow expanded roles for lay people and permanent deacons, of whom the Amazon needed ""many more"". Deacons, like priests, are ordained ministers. They can preach, teach, baptise and run parishes, but they cannot say Mass. Married men can become deacons. Because only priests can say Mass, people in at least 85% of Amazon villages cannot attend the liturgy every week and some cannot do so for years. ""This urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America ... to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region,"" he wrote. He used the first three chapters of the document to defend the rights and legacies of indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon, which had to be protected because of its vital role in mitigating global warming. Conservatives feared that if Francis had taken up the proposal, other areas with a shortage of priests would follow, even in developed countries such as Germany, where the issue is being discussed."""
Commentary: Japan’s new resource strategy to tackle climate change is risky,12 Feb 2020 06:02AM (Updated: 12 Feb 2020 06:10AM),CNA/ml,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/japan-new-strategy-to-tackle-climate-change-12422966," CANBERRA: The second Japan–Australia Economic Ministerial Dialogue was held in January in Melbourne. Before the meeting, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kajiyama described Australia as a key strategic partner for Japan. The Minister noted this year’s discussions focus on collaboration in hydrogen and carbon-recycling, in addition to trade and other issues. The introduction of carbon-recycling to Australia–Japan bilateral dialogue reflects a big change in Japan’s international resources strategy. Japan has spent huge sums of money on energy security policies to diversify the energy sources used to fuel its economy, and the locations from which it imports fuel. The Japanese nuclear power program was a central plank of this mission prior to the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster of 2011. The Japanese government is now tackling climate change in its resource strategy by introducing a suite of policies it labels carbon-recycling. In doing so, Japan is linking its technology-centred approach to climate change mitigation to long-standing energy security policies that enjoy legitimacy across all branches of government. AUSTRALIA AS A KEY PARTNER Japan’s carbon-recycling agenda includes support for technologies designed to capture carbon dioxide and use it to generate a range of commodities including chemicals, fuels and concrete products. Australia has long been a partner in Japan’s resource strategy, gaining billions of dollars in investment in natural gas, coal, and increasingly rare earth elements. It is emerging as a key partner in the new carbon-recycling initiative. On Sep 25, 2019, the then-Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to explore joint research and development into technologies that see “carbon dioxide as a resource, rather than viewing it merely as a waste product”.   The Japan–Australia Energy and Resources Dialogue was also created on June 16 as a platform to facilitate planning and implementation. Japan and Australia are natural partners in tackling climate change. Australia has the potential to be a zero-carbon export superpower, and Japan is a key technology provider to the world. Hydrogen produced by renewable energy is a potential long-term technology for decarbonising industrial sectors including steel. Japan has deployed electric vehicles more rapidly than Australia and uses energy efficiently. The machinery of government in Japan is also better geared towards developing green industry policies. Australia, on the other hand, has more experience in managing the uptake of renewables in competitive electricity markets. CARBON-RECYCLING AS A RISKY BET But Japan’s carbon-recycling strategy carries real risks. The rate of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needed to minimise the risk of catastrophic climate change is steep. Global commitments under the Paris Agreement lead to expected temperature increases of 3.2 degrees Celsius within the lifetime of a child born today. To meet a 1.5 degree Celsius global warming target, countries need to decrease carbon dioxide emissions globally by 7.6 per cent every year between now and 2030. If delayed even by five years, the rate increases to 15.4 per cent. The world is going to burn large quantities of fossil fuels for many decades to come, and it makes sense to invest in technologies that might buy more time. But collaboration on long-term solutions is not a substitute for deploying existing technologies — such as in wind, solar photovoltaics, and energy efficiency — to achieve zero-net emissions as quickly as possible. It is also not clear what the long-term benefits of carbon-recycling will be. If carbon dioxide is used to make fuels, it will re-enter the atmosphere if the fuels are burned without additional capture and storage efforts. The Japanese government’s own explanations of its new resources strategy show that one goal is to enable investment in fossil fuel production currently made marginal by environmental costs, increasing the global supply of fossil fuels.   Japan also supports building a hydrogen supply chain using fossil fuels. But even with carbon capture and storage technologies — which Japan’s ‘carbon recycling’ strategy emphasises — hydrogen can be no better than burning fossil fuels. Worryingly, Japan’s new resources strategy also includes support for the construction of coal plants. The Japanese government remains a large financer of thermal coal plants in developing countries. Japan has been criticised for supporting coal projects that are unlikely to operate for their projected lifetimes. Many Japanese companies are postponing or cancelling coal projects at home because of financial risks and exiting the coal industry abroad. Doubling down on the financing of coal technology increases money flowing to projects that are increasingly subject to stranded asset risk. Ultimately what matters is the rapid deployment of zero-carbon technologies at scale. Australia and Japan are natural partners in this effort. But it is crucial to assess whether technologies can make a real contribution to decarbonisation.

"In fire-hit rural Australia, climate debate burns deep",11 Feb 2020 07:28PM (Updated: 11 Feb 2020 07:47PM),Reuters/jt,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/in-fire-hit-rural-australia--climate-debate-burns-deep-12422084," BUCHAN, Australia: Returning from a morning feeding his sheep, Jeff McCole, a 70-year-old farmer, paused to take in the bittersweet scene – a few droplets of rain falling onto the remains of his fire-ravaged home. Nothing like the sound of rain on a tin roof,"" he said, as he scanned the residue of a lifetime of memories scattered before him. By the old front door was a charred metal toy truck his grandchildren once raced down the verandah. Under the remains of the tin roof, a collection of books, his wife's ""pride and joy"", had been reduced to layers of feathery ash. And out back, the skeleton of a Valencia orange tree, planted by his mother 65 years ago, was now laden with baubles of charcoaled fruit.   Seasonal bushfires have struck Australia in a way like never before, making for months of monster blazes and toxic haze, and fuelling a polarising debate over climate change. But in Buchan, a conservative-voting farming town in Victoria state that is home to the McCole farm, most locals said they believed the catastrophic fires had nothing to do with global warming. Climate change was ""a load of crap"", said McCole, an idea pushed by city folk with ""no experience in the bush"" and no understanding of Australia's punishing, cyclical climate. ""We've had severe droughts and everything like that, 70 years ago,"" said McCole, a Vietnam war veteran with sky-blue eyes. ""It just keeps going around in circles. If you wait, it's going to change."" RISING RISKS For decades scientists have warned that climate change would increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia. This year, there was the perfect storm – record-breaking drought and heat coalescing on tinderbox land. Before rains slowed their spread in recent days, the fires had burned through almost 12 million hectares, destroyed more than 2,800 homes, and claimed the lives of 33 people. An estimated one billion native animals are also believed to have died. Australia has one of the world's highest carbon footprints per capita and is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas, making successive governments reluctant to adopt climate change policies they say could undermine the economy. But with these unprecedented bushfires, the government has come under increased pressure from environmental groups, scientists and broader swathes of the Australian public to address the climate change issue. ""People are more fearful of the future because they glimpsed the future this summer,"" said Lesley Hughes, a professor and climate scientist at Macquarie University. ""I think it has been really wounding of the Australian psyche.""   Polling by the Australia Institute, a Canberra think tank, in January found that 79 per cent of Australians said they were concerned about climate change, up five percentage points from last July, with 47per cent ""very concerned"", a jump of 10 points. But there remains widespread scepticism that the severity of the fires is due to climate change, with many conservative politicians and media suggesting that factors such as arson, the length of cyclical droughts or poor management of flammable vegetation are more responsible. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had previously declined to discuss the link between climate change and the fires, recently acknowledged the connection, but said his priority was managing the economic impact. Morrison last week cited ""hazard reduction"" – which includes the practice of controlled burns to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the bush, as a key to mitigating fires in the future, saying it was just as important as reducing emissions. Climate scientists say that the bigger problem for Australia are longer droughts and increasingly hot summers.   The issue of controlled burns is a deeply emotional one in Buchan, where at least 20 homes were lost in the fires that struck in December. ""Climate change or not,"" said Donald Graham, a farmer who survived the fires huddled in his concrete bunker with a stack of cheese and vegemite sandwiches. ""These fires were a disaster waiting to happen."" A DEATH TRAP The road from Melbourne to Buchan winds past a series of small country towns, pie shops and historic churches and, after a weekend of rain, verdant green fields with dairy cows. But closer to Buchan, population 385, the road is eerily burnt out, lined by rows of black tree trunks sticking out of ashy ground. When the bushfires hit the town on Dec. 30, they roared in on three fronts with a ferocity that no locals had ever seen. For more than a month, fires had raged ominously in nearby bushland, finally bellowing in with ""one heck of a red glow"", McCole said.   From the verandah of his home, nestled on a 400-hectare property of rolling hills, gum trees and Merino sheep, he watched a giant orange plume crest over the hill and rain down fiery embers. ""We only had ten minutes to get out and I think that was the best call I ever made,"" he said with a wry laugh. ""It was a death trap."" The town of Buchan is a single main street with a general store and a pub - the kind of place where locals have time to discuss the pressing issues of the day with a stranger. ""The issue of climate change and the fire is a dead duck as far as I'm concerned,"" said Graham, an animated 68-year-old cattleman with a shock of gray hair. ""What is the most significant thing, is the changing structure of the forest."" Minutes before he watched his house go up in flames from the peephole of his bunker, Graham raced inside to grab a picture from the wall, a colonial lithograph featuring the magnificent valley below overlooking the confluence of the Snowy and Buchan rivers.   The picture is significant because it shows how much the land has changed, he said. ""We've got an accumulation of vegetation. Our area was burned 50 to 70 years ago and it has not burned since, and at some point it will burn,"" he said. ""It just needs a few things to come together, a few dry years and some lightning and neither of those are peculiar to the Australian landscape."" His neighbour John Coates, a 76-year-old cattle farmer, said that decades of vegetation growth had turned the land into a ""timebomb"". Walking through their property overlooking the Snowy River National Park, Coates and his wife Janice shook their heads at the destruction – bald, blackened hills and the devastated gorge below, once filled with ferns, lyrebirds and platypus in the creek. Many locals in Buchan recall the days they would carry a box of matches in their pockets so they could carry out their own hazard-reduction burns. But regulations subsequently put in place aimed at protecting state forests and bushland mean they are now dependent on government agencies for carrying out controlled burns. For years, local farmers had urged the government to carry out burns to reduce the ""fuel load"", or the accumulation of trees, underbrush and dry grass that can turn a small bushfire into an inferno, Coates said. But it never happened.   Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer for Forest Fire Management Victoria, said in a statement to Reuters that his agency had planned to burn 246,396 hectares of the state's public land last year, but was ""unable to do so because it would have been unsafe"". Scientists also say the drought and increasingly hot weather means there are fewer days that vegetation can be safely burned. Commenting on the issue in New South Wales, Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said it was not a case of failing to implement techniques that had worked in the past, but that such techniques were ""insufficient to address the scenario now"". ""You can't blame the dry conditions and say it has no relevance to climate change,"" he said. ""It's a combination of many different climatic changes that can be linked back to the overall trend."" SEASONS 'OUT OF SYNC' In Buchan, not everyone in town was averse to talk of climate change – a few spoke of the seasons being ""out of sync"", the lack of rain or the demise of fragrant yellow box flowers in the valley. But the fires have mainly reinforced pre-existing views and gripes, reflecting the polarising rhetoric of the national climate change debate. Last November, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack – who heads the party that won in the electorate that includes Buchan – described climate change concerns as those held by ""inner-city raving lunatics"".   That messaging appeared to resonate in Buchan, far from the skyscrapers and the lights of Melbourne or Sydney, with a strong sense that people here were living far greener lives. ""They blame our cows,"" said McCole, referring to recent attention on the earth-warming methane produced by belching or flatulent cattle. But, he said, ""they are all jumping on electric trains and cars and god knows what in the city and there are millions of them, flying around the world in jumbo jets."" ""It takes a good cow to put out that many emissions,"" he said. ""I can tell ya."""""
Bong Joon-ho: South Korea's boundary-pushing satirist,10 Feb 2020 01:10PM (Updated: 10 Feb 2020 02:00PM),AFP/ic(hs),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/about-bong-joon-ho-profile-south-korea-director-12416638," South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho has been on quite a wild ride this awards season. That trip reached its climax Sunday evening (Feb 9) – Monday (Feb 10) Singapore time – when he secured his country's first-ever Oscars for Parasite. The film, a vicious satire about the widening gap between rich and poor, took home Academy Awards for best original screenplay and best international feature after winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe and two Baftas. We never write to represent our countries,"" said the 50-year-old Bong. ""But this is (the) very first Oscar to South Korea. Thank you."" Later, as he accepted the prize for best international feature, he said in English, eliciting laughs from the audience: ""Yeah, I'm ready to drink tonight.""   Bong - who is known for his dark and genre-hopping thrillers - already had a series of critical and commercial hits behind him before Parasite and is one of South Korea's best-known faces. This latest triumph on Hollywood's biggest night, a rarity for an Asian auteur filmmaker, should take him to new heights. ""He's been an established director for close to 20 years and has made exceptional films,"" Jason Bechervaise, a professor at Korea Soongsil Cyber University, told AFP. ""He's also very charming and sociable. This has been a factor, I think, in how far the film has gone - having done hundreds of interviews, possibly more, and mingling with voters and the Hollywood elite."" ARTISTIC ELITE Bong grew up in an elite artistic family in Seoul - his maternal grandfather was a renowned novelist while his late father and all of his siblings are university professors in fields including fashion and fine art. He studied sociology at the South's prestigious Yonsei University and reportedly took part in street protests while enrolled there during the country's pro-democracy movement in the 1980s. Bong once told an interviewer he had been arrested for using petrol bombs. He was among the first wave of South Korean filmmakers to blossom after the country's full democratisation, which opened the door for a cultural renaissance. His Memories of Murder - a 2003 feature film based on real-life serial killings that rattled the nation in the 1980s - was seen as a metaphor for a repressive society under military rule. Bong's 2006 monster blockbuster The Host portrayed an incompetent government left helpless in the wake of a disaster. In 2014, parallels were drawn between the film and the Sewol ferry sinking that killed 300, mostly schoolchildren. His 2013 Snowpiercer depicted a dystopian future in which the last humans on Earth - who survived a failed attempt to stop global warming - travel endlessly on a train separated according to class, and the lower class revolts. Tilda Swinton, who was in Snowpiercer, also starred in Bong's Netflix-produced 2017 sci-fi action-adventure Okja about a country girl trying to save a genetically engineered beast from a greedy multinational firm. Quentin Tarantino - whose Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood was nominated for multiple Oscars this year - once likened the South Korean to ""Steven Spielberg in his prime"".   POLITICAL SUBTEXT Throughout his career, Bong has often tackled dark and difficult subjects including violent crime, systematic oppression and the climate crisis. He also has candidly spoken about dealing with severe anxiety, in a country where mental health has long been a taboo topic. ""All his films are sociology-in-motion, and all his films have a political subtext,"" said Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. ""They're all deeply inoculated with socially critical, political thought, without being preachy or obvious about it. Few other directors can do this."""""
Snow problem for Japan's ice sculpture festival,10 Feb 2020 11:37AM (Updated: 10 Feb 2020 11:39AM),AFP/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/snow-problem-for-japan-s-ice-sculpture-festival-12416462," SAPPORO, Japan: Every year, tens of thousands of tourists flock to the snow festival in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, attracted by some 200 large, but intricate ice sculptures. But this year, there's a problem: No snow. With high temperatures that festival-goers put down to climate change, organisers were forced to truck in powder from distant towns for their signature sculptures in an unheard-of ice crisis.   This lack of snow is unprecedented,"" said Yumato Sato, an official in charge of organising the snow festival, which normally uses 30,000 tonnes of the stuff for sculptures ranging from anime characters to famous racehorses. ""We had to bring in snow from places we had never reached out to before"" such as Niseko, a town about 60km away from Sapporo famous for its skiing, he said. Adding to the problem was the need for pristine snow, perfect for sculpting. ""The snow needs to be free of dirt, otherwise the sculptures can break up,"" he said. ""We barely managed to scrape together enough snow."" Record low snowfall in Japan this year has also forced many ski resorts to shut their pistes. According to Weathernews, one-quarter of the 400 resorts surveyed had been unable to operate. There has been a knock-on effect on one of the snow festival's main attractions - a 100m-long, 10m-high slide - that had to be reduced in size. 'ONCE BEFORE I DIE' Snowfall in Sapporo has been less than half the annual average, according to the Japan Meterological Agency's local observatory. High temperatures melted the snow in mid-December and the mercury is expected to stay above average. This posed a major challenge for the 125 local Self-Defense Forces troops who painstakingly construct the sculptures each year that can be as high as 15m, according to commanding officer Colonel Minoru Suzuki.   ""Due to record warm weather this year, we didn't have much snow and the snow contained more water which made the statues melt easily,"" Suzuki told AFP. His troops spent about 100 days planning and building a 15m tall, 20m wide statue modelled on the palace at Lazienki Park in Warsaw to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese-Polish diplomatic relations in 2019. ""We had to keep repairing the statue so we struggled. It was difficult to attach parts because it was so warm,"" he added. The festival has been running for 70 years and is a major tourist magnet, drawing 2.7 million visitors last year. Sunao Kinoshita, a 75-year-old who had travelled up from near Osaka, said he ""had to see it once before I die"".   ""Northern Japanese cities have been hosting snow festivals every year. It would be a shame if such events ended"" due to global warming, he said. A regular festival-goer from the region also laid the blame on global warming. ""I was worried the climate was different this year,"" Ayaka Muto, 31, told AFP. ""Usually we have more snow. I think it's strange. I feel global warming is happening,"" added Muto. 'SERIOUS AND A DISASTER' The main theme of this year's festival, which runs until Feb 11, is the ethnic Ainu minority in Hokkaido, as the first Ainu-themed national museum, nicknamed Upopoy or ""singing together"" in the Ainu language, will open in April. ""We've never before had statues with such powerful Ainu characteristics,"" Sato said.   One statue featured a giant Blakiston's fish owl spreading its wings watching over sculptures of the museum and a ship. The owl is considered a god in Ainu culture. Another statue was based on the Ainu myth of a thunder god and a forest princess. And some have been turning to the nature gods of Japan's native Shinto religion to pray for more snow. In mid-January, a ski resort in western Hyogo prefecture invited a Shinto priest to hold a ceremony to ask the gods for snow, as did the organisers of the Yamagata snow festival in northern Japan. ""It's not that we don't have enough snow. We don't have snow at all. It's serious and it's a disaster,"" Hyogo Governor Toshizo Ido told reporters last month. The Sapporo festival organisers hope they can continue the famed event in the future despite the warming climate. ""This year marked the 71st event. It's a festival that we want to carry on for future generations,"" Sato said. ""(But) this is about weather so all we can do is to pray."""""

"People in Singapore support use of clean energy, want 'more ambitious climate action': NCCS study",08 Feb 2020 02:41PM (Updated: 08 Feb 2020 03:39PM),CNA/mt(cy),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/clean-energy-singapore-nccs-study-climate-change-12410492," SINGAPORE: People in Singapore strongly support the use of clean energy to power homes, vehicles and industries, and want more ambitious climate action"", the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has found. These were among the findings from a public consultation exercise conducted by the NCCS which focused on Singapore’s long-term low emissions development strategy (LEDS). The exercise saw about 2,000 submissions from businesses, community groups, and individuals. It was held from Jul 16 to Sep 30 last year, and the findings released on Friday (Feb 7). Several stakeholder engagement sessions were also organised from August last year to January 2020 to facilitate discussions with youths, green groups, green councils, academics and businesses from a variety of sectors, said NCCS, which is part of the strategy group in the Prime Minister's Office. In general, the feedback received mirrored the results from a survey also conducted by the NCCS from May to July last year, that more Singaporeans are aware of climate change and are prepared to do more, it said. When it came to the use of clean energy, respondents indicated ""strong support"" of its use to power industries, vehicles and homes, said the NCCS. Solar energy was identified as the most viable clean energy source, with suggestions including the offering of incentives and rebates to encourage solar deployment on private and building rooftops. However, some also noted that issues like intermittency and Singapore's limited land area were ""key limiting factors"" in furthering deployment. There were also mixed responses when it came to the willingness to pay a premium for clean energy, said NCCS in a summary of its findings. Several respondents pointed out the higher costs of producing cleaner energy would increase the financial burden on lower-income households, while some said that the biggest emitters should bear the most responsibility to switch to renewable energy. In terms of climate action, some called for emissions to peak well before 2030, reach net-zero by 2050, and to be in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, said NCCS. However, respondents were also aware of the challenges involved in cutting down on emissions, noted NCCS. ""Several noted that the technologies that will enable transformational shifts to a low carbon future are still in their infancy, while others cited economic competitiveness and employment concerns,"" it said. But as technologies develop, there remains the possibility to cut Singapore's emissions further. ""We are carefully considering both the calls for climate ambition and the challenges involved in developing and implementing Singapore’s LEDS,"" said NCCS. ""We agree that, as technologies develop or mature, there will be scope for greater reduction of our emissions."" NCCS also said it recognised the concerns voiced by different stakeholders. ""Addressing climate change requires a whole-of-society effort. The Government recognises the concerns from different stakeholders, and the significant effort necessary to transit to a low carbon future,"" said NCCS. ""The Government will continue to study the suggestions, convene platforms for engagement, and explore partnerships with businesses, the community and individuals to develop solutions to build a resilient and sustainable Singapore."""""
Global warming to blame for hottest day in Argentine Antarctica,08 Feb 2020 05:47AM,AFP/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/global-warming-to-blame-for-hottest-day-in-argentine-antarctica-12408768," BUENOS AIRES: Global warming is to blame for Argentine Antarctica recording its hottest day since readings began, Greenpeace said on Friday (Feb 7). Temperatures climbed to 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit) at midday Thursday at the research station Esperanza base, the highest temperature on record since 1961, according to the National Meteorological Service. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on March 24, 2015. The new record is of course shocking but unfortunately not surprising because Antarctica is warming up with the rest of the planet,"" said Frida Bengtsson, marine environment specialist for Greenpeace, in a statement. At Marambio, another Argentine base in Antarctica, temperatures reached 14.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the hottest temperature for a day in February since 1971. The news comes after a decade of record temperatures on the planet and a 2019 that was the second hottest year since registers have been kept. And the new decade has begun along the same tendency, with last month the hottest January on record. The effects of global warming have already seen ocean levels rise due to melting ice caps. The two largest ice caps on the planet, in Antarctica and Greenland, have already lost an average of a combined 430 billion tons a year since 2006. According to UN climate experts, the oceans rose 15 centimeters during the 20th century. It's a threat to coastal towns and small islands the world over. One of the largest glaciers in Antarctica is the Thwaites glacier, which is the size of Britain. Scientists say that if it melted it would raise sea levels by 65 centimeters. ""Over the last 30 years, the amount of ice melting off Thwaites and adjacent glaciers has nearly doubled,"" said the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration group of scientists in a statement. Argentina has had a presence in Antarctica for the past 114 years, including several scientific research bases, and is also a signatory of the Antarctic Treaty, which came into force in June 1961 and prohibits any militarization of the continent."""
Antarctic base records hottest temperature ever,07 Feb 2020 11:42PM,Reuters/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctic-base-records-hottest-temperature-ever-12407530," GENEVA/BUENOS AIRES: A research base in the Antarctic has recorded the hottest temperature ever for the continent amid rising concern about global warming that has caused an increase in the melting of ice sheets around the south pole. The Esperanza base on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula recorded a temperature of 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.94 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday. (This) is not a figure you would normally associate with Antarctica even in the summertime. This beat the former record of 17.5 degrees C, which was set back in 2015,"" WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis told reporters in Geneva. ""The Antarctic peninsula ... is among the fastest warming regions of the planet. We hear a lot about the Arctic, but this particular part of the Antarctic peninsula is warming very quickly."" The temperature was recorded at the Argentine base on Thursday. Scientists believe global warming has caused so much melting at the south pole that the giant ice sheet is now on course to disintegrate. This would see an eventual global sea level rise of at least three meters (10 feet) over centuries. A WMO committee will verify whether the temperature logged by Argentina's national meteorological service is a new record for the Antarctic continent. The record in the wider Antarctic region is 19.8 degrees C in January 1982. ""The amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017,"" Nullis added, citing images showing cracks in glaciers in Antarctica. ""The melting from these glaciers, you know, means we are in big trouble when it comes to sea level rise."""""
Joker's Joaquin Phoenix takes aim at climate apathy with film about dying Earth,07 Feb 2020 12:00AM (Updated: 07 Feb 2020 07:41AM),Reuters/sr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/joker-joaquin-phoenix-climate-change-film-guardians-of-life-12402380," Oscar favourite Joaquin Phoenix stars as a medic battling to save a dying planet Earth in a film launched on Thursday (Feb 6), the first in a series of short Hollywood productions aimed at spurring action on climate change. The Joker star teamed up with environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch, a California-based organisation campaigning to protect the Amazon rainforest, to produce the two-minute film Guardians Of Life. Shot in a Los Angeles emergency room, the movie shows doctors attempting to save an unidentified patient whose flatlining vital signs represent the threat posed by climate change, deforestation and fires from Australia to the Amazon. It's really a call to action,"" said Phoenix, among the most prominent Hollywood stars to draw attention to the catastrophic damage being caused by human-induced global warming. ""People don't realise there's still time, but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We can't wait for governments to solve these problems for us."" Founded in Britain, Extinction Rebellion promotes its climate activism through civil disobedience, and Phoenix was himself arrested at a climate change protest organised by fellow Hollywood star Jane Fonda in Washington last month, a few days after winning a Golden Globe for his starring role in Joker. The first in a planned series of 12 short films, Guardians Of Life points to the vital role indigenous people play in protecting habitats, a finding emphasised by scientists studying the million plant and animal species they say risk extinction due to damage caused by industrial society. ""This film is very important for us at this moment,"" said Sonia Guajajara, head of Brazil's largest indigenous umbrella organisation, the Association of Indigenous Peoples. ""It demonstrates the artists' engagement in Amazon protection by showing the key role indigenous peoples play in defending the forests, the planet, and life itself."" Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine and Oona Chaplin appear alongside Phoenix in the film. It was directed by Shaun Monson and produced with Mobilize Earth, a US not-for-profit organisation set up for the series, and aims to raise money for Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch. ""There is still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen,"" said Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion. ""But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real."" (Source: Reuters)"""
Motor Rally - Lack of snow forces Rally Sweden to shorten course for WRC event,05 Feb 2020 08:20PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/motor-rally---lack-of-snow-forces-rally-sweden-to-shorten-course-for-wrc-event-12398046," STOCKHOLM: The Swedish round of the world rally championship will go ahead on Feb. 13 over a shortened course due to an unusually mild winter and a lack of snow, organizers Rally Sweden said on Wednesday.

Electric future: Britain to ban new petrol and hybrid cars from 2035,,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/electric-future--britain-to-ban-new-petrol-and-hybrid-cars-from-2035-12390628," LONDON: Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. We have to deal with our CO2 emissions, and that is why the UK is calling for us to get to net zero as soon as possible, to get every country to announce credible targets to get there – that’s what we want from Glasgow,"" Johnson said on Tuesday at a launch event for COP26 at London's Science Museum, alongside broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. ""We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act."" The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming with responsibility for persuading big polluting countries to agree more ambitious emissions cuts falling on the British hosts. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050, but Greenpeace UK Head of Politics Rebecca Newsom said Johnson needed to take broader action than cleaning up transport. ""We need a complete rethink of the way we power our economy, build homes, move around and grow our food,"" she said. Britain's step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040 and Norway's parliament has set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars should be zero emissions. ELECTRIC VEHICLES While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail. The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest global export market for its car manufacturers, amounting to about 20per cent of global sales, and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants. The government said that, subject to consultation, it planned to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible. Diesel and petrol models still account for 90per cent of sales in Britain, and prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost. The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds (US$3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1,000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets. It has also provided investment for the development of electric vehicle technology. Johnson's launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit's former head Clare O'Neill who was sacked from the post last week. Johnson declined to answer any questions on O'Neill, but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister. A government source suggested her replacement would most likely to announced in a wider reshuffle of government posts expected this month. O'Neill, a former energy minister, accused Johnson of a lack of leadership and said he had admitted to her he did not understand climate change.

Britain to bring forward ban on new petrol and diesel cars,,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/britain-bring-forward-new-petrol-diesel-cars-ban-2035-12390042," LONDON: Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow UN Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. Johnson will launch COP26, a two-week conference seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming, at an event alongside Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. Hosting COP26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change,"" Johnson said in a statement released by his office ahead of a speech in London on Tuesday. ""As we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions."" Britain's step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. Countries around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. France plans to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040 and Norway's parliament has set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars should be zero emissions. ELECTRIC VEHICLES While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future where electric vehicles, or perhaps even driverless ones, prevail. The government said that, subject to consultation, it planned to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible. It also said it would include hybrids. Diesel and petrol models still account for 90 per cent of sales in Britain, and prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost. Johnson's launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit's former head Clare O'Neill who was sacked from the post last week. O'Neill, a former energy minister, accused Johnson of a lack of leadership and said he had admitted to her he did not understand climate change. ""My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises - whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed family members - is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it, and make sure the money is in the bank,"" she told BBC radio. Johnson will call for international efforts to reach net zero as early as possible, including through investment in cleaner technology, preservation of natural habitats and measures to improve resilience to the impact of climate change."""
Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?,01 Feb 2020 06:01AM (Updated: 01 Feb 2020 06:10AM),CNA/ml,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-koreans-evacuated-from-wuhan-12374476," SEOUL: In the South Korean city of Asan this week, residents held angry protests decrying their government’s decision to quarantine South Koreans evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the growing outbreak of a new coronavirus, at a facility in their community. Among the many placards at the protest -- hung between pieces of heavy construction equipment to block the road to the facilities -- was one that read “Asan citizens first.” Protest signs are meant to convey simple, snappy messages and don’t have room for much context. But it was clear from this slogan that the people of Asan felt that their government should put them first, that they shouldn’t have to forego any of their interests, or risk their own health, to accommodate fellow citizens fleeing the hub of a public health crisis. In explaining their opposition, locals have said that the government picked Asan, and another city called Jincheon, as the quarantine sites without consulting them first. They have also pointed out that the quarantine facilities are in densely populated areas, where many children live. NOT IN MY BACKYARD Social scientists have dubbed this way of thinking NIMBYism, with NIMBY being the acronym for “not in my backyard,” a phenomenon whereby people in a certain location resist some change to the place that they live on no grounds other than that the proposed change, while being necessary or at least beneficial in a general sense for the wider society, isn’t good for their specific community or locality. Pretty much everyone can agree that a country must have garbage dumps and sewage treatment facilities, yet no one wants those facilities near where they live because of the adverse effects on property values and quality of life. The locals in Asan were not arguing that their fellow South Koreans should be banned from returning to their country or that the national government had no responsibility to help get them out of Wuhan. They simply, for entirely selfish reasons, want them sent elsewhere.   Curiously absent from this display of fiery dissent in Asan was any suggestion of what to do with the roughly 700 returnees. No South Korean city was likely to raise its hand and volunteer to host hundreds of people who could have been exposed to the deadly, poorly understood virus at this stage of the outbreak, when the number of cases is rising daily and no one knows how bad the outbreak could get. One might have expected that at this stage, cities would be willing to step forward and contribute to the state’s handling of the public health crisis, to shoulder risk and burden as a way of working toward a solution. A NEW FACE OF SOCIETY This case contrasts sharply with a heart-warming story of South Korean cooperation and sacrifice not too long ago. In 1998, as the country was reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis and the national government was billions of dollars in debt, citizens lined up to donate gold to help the nation climb out of debt. That story was upheld as demonstration of a deep social bond, of citizens willing to, at a time of economic disaster, give up personal assets to help out the country. Would anything like that happen today? South Koreans have long lamented that that same crisis in the late 1990s changed their country forever, introducing neoliberal economics, eroding the country’s previous model of jobs for life and family-like companies. The crisis paved the way for a more competitive, individualistic South Korea where nothing is guaranteed and average citizens, like those who protested in Asan this week, see their society’s elites as corrupt and out of touch. FOR THE WIDER GOOD South Korea is a democracy, and democracies require a peculiar balancing of individual rights and collective goals.   Citizens have a role to play in picking their leaders and agitating for policy decisions, but there are limits on what they can achieve. At some point, all citizens are asked to grit their teeth and accept things they may not like. In democracies, anyone who fulfils a duty to their state that requires they risk their own life -- career soldiers, police officers, emergency workers -- does so with their own consent. The preamble to South Korea’s constitution states, the provision of “equal opportunities to every person and provide for the fullest development of individual capabilities” as a goal. Unfortunately there is a contradiction in that, as at some point, particular individuals must sacrifice for collective well-being. LESSONS FROM THE PAST As the first chartered flight carrying 368 Koreans from Wuhan landed at the Gimpo International Airport on Friday (Jan 31) morning amidst continued anger among some residents in Asan and Jincheon, I couldn’t help but ponder about how this could messy situation could have been averted or resolved. A potentially effective solution during a dispute like this is a show of leadership, for someone in a position of responsibility to set an example for the concerned citizens of Asan by showing that they are willing to take on some of the burden. Or for someone to show by example – which in this case would have been one of the cities putting up its hands to say they would welcome their evacuated fellow citizens to be quarantined in their neighbourhood. On the other hand, the government has acted more decisively than the last time an epidemic hit the nation – the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 – by putting into quarantine and issuing medical assistance to infected persons early while also announcing that it will be drawing from an emergency fund to contain the virus as it aims to calm residents and investors.   But it can still do better. Specifically, in this case of quarantining the evacuated Koreans, it ought to clearly communicate that the authorities are working actively to contain the corona virus outbreak, and has learned lessons about the need for strict quarantine from the MERS experience, when the government garnered criticism for failing to quarantine people who had been exposed to the virus. For now, the protests appear to have simmered down as the residents of Asan reportedly came to a decision to back down after an hour-long meeting on Friday. But with more than 300 Koreans left to be evacuated from Wuhan, the unrest may yet get new life in the coming days. This makes the communication from government an ongoing effort to ease citizens’ worries. Political leadership handbooks also point to the importance of empathy, of leaders demonstrating that they care how their citizens feel. Asan citizens might feel more at ease if President Moon Jae-in came to their community to walk the city streets and listen to people’s concerns. At the very least, that would allow Moon’s government to send the key message: We’re all in this together.

Reports of landlords evicting people on home quarantine or leave of absence 'troubling': Iswaran,31 Jan 2020 09:22PM (Updated: 31 Jan 2020 09:44PM),CNA/ga(hs),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-landlords-evicting-quarantine-troubling-12375140," SINGAPORE: Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said on Friday (Jan 31) that the Government has heard troubling or disturbing stories"" of landlords who are evicting people serving their home quarantine or taking leave of absence, as Singapore ramps up on precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus here. ""This is not the kind of response we need,"" said Mr Iswaran in a press conference, which was also attended by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority commissioner Marvin Sim. ""We are all in this together. Those on quarantine or leave of absence are subject to this for the sake of the wider community so that the rest of us do not run the risk of infection. ""We do not know how this situation will evolve and there may be other cases that need similar action. It is an overall national effort,"" said Mr Iswaran. Earlier on Friday, the World Health Organization had declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. ""This means the global community now has an even greater impetus to work together to contain the virus and then to eradicate the threat,"" said Mr Iswaran. He cited the widened travel restrictions announced by Mr Wong during the press conference, which blocks entry for new visitors with recent travel history to China, including Chinese passport holders who are not Singapore permanent residents or long-term pass holders. Singapore residents returning from China will have to take a 14-day leave of absence. The Ministry of Education said on Friday morning that nearly 1,000 students and staff are currently on leave of absence after returning from China. Other measures include the nationwide mask distribution, which starts on Saturday, as well as the use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) legislations to tackle the spread of false information. With all these measures, ""there will be some disruptions to our daily lives"", said Mr Iswaran, calling on the ""understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans"". He praised the efforts of Singaporeans who have been buying food and running errands for their neighbours who are under quarantine. “These are heart-warming efforts, and it speaks loudly of the big heart and resilient spirit of Singaporeans,” he said. “That is the spirit that we need and we want to stand together to defeat the virus and the challenge it poses. We have done it before, as with SARS, and we can do it again.” NO COMMUNITY SPREAD IN SINGAPORE There remains no community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of Friday evening. Three new cases were confirmed by MOH, one of whom was a Singaporean who was evacuated from Wuhan earlier in the week. The 13 previously confirmed cases are in stable condition and making ""good clinical progress"", said Mr Mak. None of them are critically ill, he added. Fifteen of the total confirmed cases are Chinese nationals who had travelled to the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. “To date, there’s no evidence of any local spread to any Singapore resident in Singapore and we remain watchful and vigilant to make sure that this continues to be so. Contact tracing for contacts of our local cases continues, and it is still underway,"" he said. Asked about the possibility of cancelling events such as the Singapore Air Show over virus fears, Mr Wong said scheduled events will proceed as planned but precautions will be taken. Some attendees may be prevented from showing up due to the travel restrictions, but there are no plans to cancel the Air Show at this stage, he added.

Greta Thunberg patents her own name to stem misuse,30 Jan 2020 02:43AM (Updated: 30 Jan 2020 09:59AM),Reuters/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greta-thunberg-patents-name-climate-action-davos-12368306," STOCKHOLM: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg said on Instagram on Wednesday (Jan 29) she has applied to register her name and that of the Fridays For Future movement she founded in 2018 in order to prevent them from being hijacked for fraudulent purposes. The move would allow legal action against persons or companies trying to use her name or the movement's which are not in line with its values, she said. I assure you, I and the other school strikers have absolutely no interests in trademarks. But unfortunately it needs to be done,"" she said on the social network. She complained that ""there are still people who are trying to impersonate me or falsely claim that they 'represent' me in order to communicate with high profile people, politicians, media, artists etc"". Thunberg said she had also applied to trademark ""Skolstrejk for klimatet"", school strike for the climate in Swedish - the wording on the placard she has held since she started her one-person protest outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, for which she missed school. ""My name and the #FridaysForFuture movement are constantly being used for commercial purposes without any consent whatsoever. It happens for instance in marketing, selling of products and people collecting money in my and the movement's name,"" she wrote on her Instagram account. Thunberg, who took centre stage at the Global Economic Forum in Davos this month, and her fellow young activists in the movement want politicians to listen to climate scientists and take action to curb global warming. Thunberg, whose protests have attracted millions of young people across the globe, also said she was setting up a non-profit-making foundation to handle the financial side of Fridays for Future, such as book royalties, donations and prize money. She insisted that the foundation would be ""completely transparent,"" for example, with regard to the taxes it has to pay. ""The foundation's aim will be to promote ecological, climatic and social sustainability, as well as mental health,"" the campaigner wrote."""
Commentary: Thailand gives up plastic bags yet leaves rampant consumerism intact,29 Jan 2020 06:26AM (Updated: 29 Jan 2020 06:30AM),CNA/el(sl),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/thailand-bangkok-plastic-environment-policy-climate-change-army-12323332," LONDON: Thailand recently took an important step towards environmental protection when 75 leading retailers stopped issuing plastic bags to shoppers. This step continues a campaign started by environmentalists and local governments in Thailand to reduce urban waste and pollution. The long-term plan is to ban all single-use plastics by 2021. Thai newspapers have shown customers responding in good faith to the ban. Many are taking wheelbarrows and buckets to supermarkets, and others are re-using sacks made for transporting sugar and rice. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER? But critics ask why it has taken so long. The first bans of lightweight plastic bags took place in Bangladesh and India in 2002. China banned lightweight bags in 2008. And Thailand’s role in producing plastic waste has been known for years. A recent article in Science shows that, in terms of national averages, Thailand is the world’s sixth largest dumper of plastic. Adjusting these figures for coastal populations and coral reefs, Thailand leads the world. According to the article, Thais and visitors to Thailand will – knowingly or otherwise – throw some 8.9 million plastic items into sewers and canals by 2025, resulting in more than half a million tonnes of waste in the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea. Recent news stories in Thailand have reported occasions of animals, including a deer and baby dugong, dying from eating plastic bags.   RAMPANT CONSUMERISM Despite its late arrival, the new plastic ban is a welcome and pragmatic step. Yet too often, attempts at regulating plastic use are wrapped up in the consumerism they seek to control. From 2008 to 2010, shops in Bangkok started a temporary craze of selling reusable bags with the words “global warming” on them. Meanwhile, supermarkets in central Bangkok remain icily air-conditioned and their products overly packaged. Bangkok’s annual carbon use has risen from some 7 tonnes per person in 2005 to nearly 11 tonnes today. This is higher than London, New York City and Tokyo (but about the same as Beijing). It is also more than twice Thailand’s national carbon average of nearly 4 tonnes per person. Governments have often supported these trends. In 2012, first-time car buyers received tax breaks, choking Thailand’s already crowded streets by an additional half a million cars. One factor impeding long-term environmental planning is Thailand’s chaotic politics and military coups. These have also shaped environmentalism itself. Like other countries, Thailand’s environmentalism reflects broader worries about the impact of growth on social order and tradition.   Much historic environmentalism in Thailand focused on fears about lost wilderness and heritage. Colourful paintings on the walls of schools and public buildings often show images of bucolic rural landscapes or threatened wildlife that present the “environment” as something remote from cities. Another theme in local environmentalism is the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy promoted by the late King Bhumibol, who ruled Thailand for 70 years until his death in 2016. Sufficiency economy presents a mode of living that urges moderation and tradition. It is promoted widely in Thailand by official sources. But the US embassy once described it — in emails exposed by Wikileaks — as “vague and malleable”, popular only because of a “public reluctance to criticise anything associated with the revered King”. POPULAR ENVIRONMENTALISM Despite these limitations, environmentalism in Thailand has served an important purpose in harnessing opposition to military governments. The last military government of 2014 to 2019 banned public gatherings of more than five people and curbed other forms of dissent. Yet, in 2018, more than 1000 people gathered in Thailand’s northern capital of Chiang Mai to protest against a government luxury housing project on forested land near the revered national park and Buddhist temple of Doi Suthep. Ironically, a similar proposal was made and criticised during 1980 to 1990 by the prime minister deposed by the military in 2006, Thaksin Shinawatra. One of Thailand’s earliest environmental controversies was opposition to a proposed cable car on Doi Suthep in the 1960s.   Environmentalism has its strongest legitimacy in the public eye when it opposes what is seen as state corruption and where it involves national heritage and wilderness. So, a consequence of this pattern is that popular environmentalism might only be effective on selected topics, and that necessary restrictions on other topics such as plastics are ignored. Thailand’s new ban on plastic bags is a sign that environmental policies are becoming more effective. But there are many more steps to take. The ban needs to be enforced and extended. Climate change policy needs to adopt more efficient and renewable sources of energy. Replacing fossil fuels with technologies such as hydrogen cells and solar panels are priorities for public transport and home heating, and so are addressing excessive packaging and air conditioning. What is needed is a root-and-branch rethinking of environmental priorities and an awareness that much popular environmentalism tends to romanticise Thailand’s past rather than think pragmatically about its future.

"Commentary: When it comes to climate change, Japan’s leaders need to walk the talk",25 Jan 2020 01:19PM (Updated: 25 Jan 2020 01:20PM),CNA/ml,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/is-japan-delivering-on-climate-change-nuclear-oil-fossil-fuels-12311532," TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly pledged that his country would lead global efforts to address climate change. Increasingly, however, Japan is facing scrutiny over the gap between its lofty rhetoric and the reality of its climate policies, which include on-going support for coal-fired power, and inadequate emission reduction targets. Shinjiro Koizumi, the environment minister, mounted only a half-hearted defence of Japan’s policy mix when he told the COP25 climate summit in Madrid last month that he was aware of global criticism and added: A growing number of people in Japan, including myself, believe further climate actions must be taken. The calls – from inside and outside government – for more ambitious policy moves come at a critical time. This year, Japan, like other Paris Agreement signatories, will be urged to review and ideally increase its emission pledges ahead of the November climate conference in Glasgow. MORE CUTS NEEDED So how, exactly, is Japan falling short? For starters, analysts say its near-term target isn’t consistent with the scale of cuts required to prevent more damaging climate impacts. Japan is pledging to reduce emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 compared with 2013 levels – a baseline year in which fossil fuel use had spiked, in part because the country’s nuclear reactors went offline after the 2011 Fukushima meltdowns. The website Climate Action Tracker, made up of a consortium of climate research institutes and consultants, rates the target as “highly insufficient”, noting that it is actually closer to 23 per cent once credits for land use and forestry measures are excluded, while warning “if all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming could reach over 3 degrees Celsius and up to 4 degrees Celsius.” The globe has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, Japan and other signatories committed to holding the global temperature rise this century to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and “to pursue efforts” to limit it to just 1.5 degrees Celsius.   While 1.5 degrees of warming will increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth, these risks will grow even further with 2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC notes that globally, carbon dioxide emissions must decline by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In other words, the coming decade is vital. WALK THE TALK If Japan wants to lead global efforts, as Abe claims, it could consider adopting a more ambitious near-term target to help gain the credibility needed to encourage other major emitters to act. At the moment, however, Japan’s plans for its energy sector this decade continue to place a significant emphasis on fossil fuels while embracing a gradual shift to renewables. Coal, LNG and oil are still projected to account for a combined 56 per cent of Japan’s energy mix in 2030, confirming Japan’s on-going status as a major export market for Australian coal and gas. Renewables, meanwhile, are pegged at about 22 per cent to 24 per cent in 2030 – a goal that Taro Kono, the defence minister, has previously criticised as lamentably low. Nuclear power is earmarked to supply 20 per cent to 22 per cent of the energy mix at the end of the decade, even though the reopening of reactors has been slowed by tighter regulatory checks and legal challenges post-Fukushima. COAL TREATMENT While several coal-fired power station projects have been cancelled over the last couple of years, units with capacity totalling 13 gigawatts are either planned or already under construction across the country, according to the Japan Coal Plant Tracker.   Japan is also financing or providing other support for coal-fired power station projects abroad, via public entities such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Koizumi was reported by Japanese media to have pushed for tighter curbs on coal power plant exports in the lead-up to the climate conference last month but was blocked amid resistance from the industry ministry. He alluded to his disappointment when he informed COP25 delegates that he was afraid he was unable to share any new developments regarding coal policy. In the longer term, Japan is pledging to achieve net zero emissions “as early as possible in the second half of this century”, a vague timeframe that leaves plenty of wiggle room for delayed transformation across what is the world’s third-largest economy. Again, the IPCC has indicated that the 1.5-degrees Celsius warming limit could be out of reach unless global carbon dioxide emissions fall to net zero by around 2050. Japan’s strategy looks tentative compared with those of the United Kingdom, which passed a law last year requiring it to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, and the European Union, which also is aiming for mid-century. Japan’s long-term strategy highlights the country’s potential strengths as it moves to decarbonise the economy and emphasises the need for “disruptive innovation”. With a significant automotive industry, for example, Japan can win from the rising use of electric vehicles, and Japan is also eyeing opportunities from hydrogen – a potential area of cooperation with Australia. But all of this needs to be underpinned by decisive political leadership to build momentum in international climate negotiations. Abe says he wants to lead. This year, he has a chance to prove it.

Warren calls on big US banks to disclose preparation for climate risk,23 Jan 2020 12:00AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/warren-calls-on-big-us-banks-to-disclose-preparation-for-climate-12304564," SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, is asking the biggest US banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,"" Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. ""I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution's practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,"" she said in the letters, provided to Reuters. She asked for detailed written responses by Feb 7. Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action. The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world's largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming. Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account. At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the US Federal Reserve signalled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system. But overall, US financial regulators lag their peers abroad. The current Republican US administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. STRESS TESTS On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken centre stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as ""perennial prophets of doom."" Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party’s nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for US president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow US Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls. All three are in favour of more government action to reduce US carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the US economy. Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to ""stress test"" banks' resilience to climate-related financial risks. In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law. She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response. ""As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank's adaptation and mitigation strategies,"" Warren wrote. Many large US banks, including those receiving Warren's letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board. Reuters asked each bank for comment on Warren's letter after normal business hours. A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education."""
Trump 'would have loved' to have met Thunberg at Davos,22 Jan 2020 08:48PM (Updated: 22 Jan 2020 08:50PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-would-have-loved-to-have-met-thunberg-at-davos-12303848," DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday (Jan 22) he would have loved to have met Swedish environment activist Greta Thunberg at Davos but added that she should not focus her anger on the United States. I would have loved to have seen her,"" Trump told reporters before leaving the luxury Swiss resort, while claiming that countries other than the United States were the worst polluters and ""Greta ought to focus on those places"". Trump had launched an extraordinary attack on environmental campaigners in a speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday, saying they were ""perennial prophets of doom"" and the ""heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Thunberg sat quietly through the speech and was unrepentant in later remarks. ""Our house is still on fire,"" she said. Trump denied he thought global warming was a hoax, saying: ""No not at all - I think aspects of it are."" He said campaigners had put global warming ""at a level that is unrealistic"" to the point where people cannot live their lives. Also speaking at Davos, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the administration's policies, saying its views had been misinterpreted. ""The US administration believes in clean air and clean water. This is a very complicated issue. We support a clean environment we just think it can be done in a way that is pro-business,"" he said."""
Trump rejects environmental 'prophets of doom' at Davos forum,21 Jan 2020 08:29PM (Updated: 21 Jan 2020 10:53PM),AFP/Reuters/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-rejects-environment-prophets-of-doom-greta-thunberg-davos-12296992," DAVOS, Switzerland: US President Donald Trump took aim on Tuesday (Jan 21) at the perennial prophets of doom"" on the environment, telling the annual Davos forum that warnings of climate crisis were ""foolish"". In a keynote speech to the 50th World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, Trump touted fossil fuels, deregulation and a booming US economy - a message in stark contrast to the dire warnings delivered by teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg and others.  ""We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,"" Trump said hours after Thunberg told the World Economic Forum that governments had done ""basically nothing"" to reverse climate change. With Thunberg in the audience, Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down.   Trump ticked off what he said were previous predictions that had been proved wrong, ranging from over-population in the 1960s to ""an end of oil"" in the 1990s. ""We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy,"" said Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November. Trump took the stage in Davos just after the Swiss president delivered a speech appealing for the world to care for the planet. But the US leader heralded the United States as ""number one producer of oil and natural gas"". He rattled off numbers indicating what he said were huge savings for American consumers and invited Europe to buy more US energy products. The expansion of oil, gas and coal production has ""been so successful that the United States no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations"", he said. ""Our European allies no longer have to be vulnerable"" if they ""use America's vast supply"". Trump said the United States was joining a newly announced international initiative called the ""one trillion trees"" project and he said he wanted to conserve ""the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world."" ""I'm a very big believer in the environment. I want the cleanest water and the cleanest air,"" he added. But he said technical innovation, not restricting economic growth, is the way forward. ""Fear and doubt is not a good thought process,"" he said. Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz said the strongest thing about Trump's speech was that it was scheduled between sessions on climate change. He criticised the President's swipe at climate 'pessimists'. ""As if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there,"" Stiglitz said. ""It's astounding."" In Washington, the impeachment trial begins in earnest in the US Senate after the Republican president was formally charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December with ""high crimes and misdemeanours"". Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges."""
Davos financiers pump US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels: Greenpeace,21 Jan 2020 07:32PM (Updated: 21 Jan 2020 07:40PM),AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/davos-financiers-pump-us-1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels-12296738,"  PARIS: Some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested US$1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal, Greenpeace said on Tuesday (Jan 21) at the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. With the climate emergency expected to be front and centre at the annual summit of the world's business elite, the charity accused some institutions in attendance of failing to live up to the Forum's goal of improving the state of the world"". Greenpeace analysed the portfolios of 24 of the banks represented at Davos and found that they had financed the fossil fuel industry to the tune of US$1.4 trillion since the landmark 2015 Paris deal. That accord enjoins nations to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius through a rapid and wide-ranging drawdown of planet-warming carbon emissions. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on the subject - says that for a better-than-even chance of reaching the safer Paris cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius, oil and gas consumption would need to decline 37 per cent and 25 per cent respectively by 2030. The IPCC says coal use must fall two thirds by 2030 and fall to virtually zero by mid-century to keep Earth on a 1.5-Celsius path. Yet carbon emissions are growing every year as global energy demand surges, and the International Energy Association said Monday that fossil fuel companies are still only investing 0.8 per cent of their spending in renewables. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said financial institutions were complicit in climate change by funding the fuels that drive it. ""Banks, insurers and pension funds are as culpable for the climate emergency as the fossil fuel industry - specifically those that go to Davos,"" Morgan told AFP. ""These Davos players say they support the Paris agreement but since its signing they've pumped US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels."" 'PROPPING UP DIRTY ENERGY' The Greenpeace report found that just 10 banks had provided US$1 trillion to fossil fuels since Paris. That same amount could pay to double the world's solar power capacity. It also identified three pension funds with at least US$26 billion in fossil fuel holdings, and alleged that four of the world's biggest insurance firms - AIG, Prudential, Sompo and Tokio marine - had no publicly disclosed policies to divest from fossil fuels. ""The fossil fuel industry needs the finance sector but its not the same the other way around, so why are these bank, insurers and pensions propping up dirty energy?"" asked Morgan, who will be participating in the four-day Davos forum. Last year green groups issued the Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card, identifying a rise in funding for coal, oil and gas each year since Paris was signed. ""The massive scale at which global banks continue to pump billions of dollars into fossil fuels is flatly incompatible with a liveable future,"" said Alison Kirsh, climate and energy lead researcher at Rainforest Action Network."""
"Thunberg, Trump offer competing visions at climate-focused Davos",21 Jan 2020 01:35PM (Updated: 21 Jan 2020 09:57PM),AFP/nc/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/thunberg-trump-offer-competing-visions-at-climate-focused-davos-12294892," DAVOS, Switzerland: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jan 21) assailed environmental prophets of doom"", delivering an uncompromising message in Davos after Swedish teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg slammed government inaction on the climate crisis. Thunberg was in the audience in the Swiss Alps to hear a typically bullish speech by Trump, delivered just before the start of his Senate impeachment trial in Washington. The 50th meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) got under way in the ski resort with an avowed focus on climate change but with starkly different visions over global warming laid bare. ""We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,"" said Trump, growling that ""they want to see us do badly"". He claimed that ""alarmists"" had been wrong on previous occasions by predicting population crisis, mass starvation and the end of oil. Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Trump told reporters later that his Davos trip was devoted to meeting ""the most important people in the world and we're bringing back tremendous business"". ""The other's just a hoax,"" he said of the ""disgraceful"" impeachment trial. 'NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE' Before Trump's appearance, Thunberg underlined the message that has inspired millions around the world, saying ""basically nothing has been done"" to fight climate change. ""It will require much more than this. This is just the very beginning,"" the 17-year-old said. Speaking calmly and with a wry smile, Thunberg acknowledged that her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving concrete change. ""There is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something,"" she said. While the WEF and individual business leaders have been detailing their own concerns about climate change, Greenpeace complained in a new report that some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested US$1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal in 2016. Trump in his speech reeled off a list of achievements for the American economy and touted the United States as the ""number one producer of oil and natural gas"". DAVOS SHOWDOWN? There are no expectations that Trump and Thunberg, who have exchanged barbs through Twitter, would actually meet, but the crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out. When Trump and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last year at the annual General Assembly, a photo of the teenager staring in apparent fury at the president from the sidelines went viral. Although Trump's Republican party holds a majority in the Senate and is almost sure to acquit him on charges of abusing his power and obstructing Congress, the impeachment adds volatility to an already tense 2020 presidential election. ""We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy,"" said Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November. 'GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO FAIL' Sustainability is the buzzword at the Davos forum, which began in 1971, with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on the icy streets rather than use cars, and the signage paint made out of seaweed. Trump's opposition to renewable energy, his withdrawal from the Paris accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and the free hand extended to the fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with the thrust of this year's event. ""People are paying a lot more attention"" to climate, Eurasia Group president Ian Bremner told AFP at Davos, adding there was ""genuine action by some big players"", after investment titan BlackRock said it was partially divesting out of coal. ""But let's be clear - a big part of this is because we failed for a very long time and governments continue to fail,"" he added. Business leaders are likely also to be concerned by the state of the global economy whose prospects, according to the International Monetary Fund, have improved but remain brittle. The IMF cut its global growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 per cent, saying that a recent truce in the trade war between China and the US had brought some stability but that risks remained. Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete action to fight inequality, after Oxfam issued a report outlining how the number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the world's 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa."""
UK puts visas into pitch for post-Brexit trade with Africa,21 Jan 2020 06:51AM,AFP/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/brexit-uk-africa-trade-boris-johnson-visas-12293880," LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson told African leaders Monday (Jan 20) that Britain would be more open to migrants from their continent after Brexit as he hosted a summit intended to boost trading ties. He also promised an end to direct UK state investment in thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas, saying London would focus on supporting a switch to low-carbon energy sources. Opening the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, Johnson made a clear pitch for business less than two weeks before Britain leaves the European Union. He told the conference involving 16 national leaders and representatives of another five countries, he wanted to make Britain their investment partner of choice"". After highlighting all Britain has to offer, he said Brexit would mean an end to preferential treatment for EU migrants. ""Our (immigration) system is becoming fairer and more equal between all our global friends and partners, treating people the same, wherever they come from,"" he said. ""By putting people before passports we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be."" Johnson met with the presidents of Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana and Uganda at the summit, and was due to hold talks with the leaders of Egypt and Kenya on Tuesday. Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari said Brexit offered an opportunity for increased free trade across the Commonwealth - and highlighted visas as a key issue. ""While many in the African diaspora enjoy considerable benefits from life in the West, they do not always feel at the heart of the community,"" he wrote in The Times newspaper on Monday. ""A renewed sense that there are ties that bind us through the Commonwealth, and a concerted effort to grow those links through trade, could act as a spur to encourage togetherness and the certainty of belonging."" BREATHE THE SAME AIR The prime minister also announced a shift in investment strategy to help combat global warming, ahead of Glasgow staging the next UN climate change summit later this year. ""There's no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn, if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it, is there?"" he said. ""We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky. We all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms."" He added: ""Not another penny of UK taxpayers money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. ""Instead, we're going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives."" Campaign group Greenpeace UK welcomed the announcement, although it said Britain could do more. ""It's great that in the middle of a climate emergency the UK government is finally putting a stop to taxpayers' money being used to support coal plants and mines abroad,"" executive director John Sauven said. ""But if Britain wants to lead by example, it should also urgently phase out support for oil and gas developments, which are pushing the world closer to climate chaos."" Sub-Saharan African faces a number of environmental challenges, particularly the effects of climate change, water and air pollution, desertification, deforestation and over-fishing. INCREASE ""RISK APPETITE"" The government's export agency reports providing £2 billion (US$2.6 billion) in financing for British company exports to Africa in the past two years. The agency says it now wants to ""increase its risk appetite"" in Egypt and the emerging economies in Nigeria and Rwanda. British and African firms announced 27 commercial deals worth £6.5 billion at the summit, from energy provision in Cote D'Ivoire to road projects in Ghana and breweries in Kenya. Britain will leave the EU on Jan 31, although ties will remain the same for 11 months while the two sides thrash out a new trading relationship. London wants to leave the bloc's single market and customs union to allow it to strike trade deals with other countries, even if this brings new barriers to EU trade."""
Climate change pushes investors to take their temperature,20 Jan 2020 03:10PM (Updated: 20 Jan 2020 06:00PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-pushes-investors-to-take-their-temperature-12289500," LONDON: Move over revenue growth and dividend payouts: it's time to take your portfolio's temperature. Policymakers are pushing investors to do more to ensure their portfolio choices help to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change by limiting planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5C. A vanguard of insurers and pension funds, many of whom will be in Davos this week for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, say part of the answer is a new temperature score"" that gives a snapshot of how their investments are contributing to climate change. A single score, they say, can help them navigate the reallocation of capital from heavily polluting sectors of the global economy likely to take a financial hit to greener companies poised to profit. So far, the temperature metric has been adopted by only a handful of the thousands of financial institutions worldwide but the buzz it has generated shows how investors' concerns about climate risk are finally moving into the mainstream. ""There's still a massive amount of work to be done on this but it's very encouraging that we as an industry are being forced to answer this temperature score question,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management. ""If you thought you could ignore climate change before, you just can't anymore."" France is leading the way with 18 firms, including insurer AXA and reinsurer Scor, disclosing the temperature score of all or part of their portfolios in 2018. British regulators have flagged that they could require some banks and insurers to report temperature scores from 2021 in annual portfolio stress tests. Asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen, German reinsurer Munich Re, Swiss rival Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance all told Reuters they were considering assigning temperature scores to their portfolios. INCREMENTAL INDICATOR Temperature scores are one of several investor-led initiatives to spring up in the last few years as policymakers crank up the pressure on the financial industry to accelerate change. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European body of mainly pension funds and asset managers with 30 trillion euros (US$33 trillion) of combined assets under management, launched an initiative in May to work out how members can use their financial clout to back the Paris goals. That was followed by the launch of the ""Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance"" at a U.N. climate summit in September. The group, which has so far signed up 16 insurers and pension funds with combined assets of almost US$4 trillion, has pledged to align investments with the most ambitious Paris temperature targets. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, last week announced an overhaul of the way it approaches climate risk. Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the ""strongest foundation"" for client portfolios. Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with US$25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development. ""This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition,"" David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters. TRICKY CALCULATION Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number. Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager Schroders, said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be ""robust and logical"". ""There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work,"" he said. Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their ""carbon intensity"" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue. A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time. Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C. ""The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like,"" said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores. The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers. Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer. ""A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits,"" said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI. ""You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future."" STRANDED ASSETS Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years. The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory. Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy. Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities. Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as ""warming potentials"" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions. ""Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,"" said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month. The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz British rival Aviva and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C. AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C. ""The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?"" he said. ""We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down.""

IEA warns oil companies doing nothing on emissions is not an option,20 Jan 2020 08:35AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/iea-warns-oil-companies-doing-nothing-on-emissions-is-not-an-option-12287434," PARIS: Oil and gas companies must boost investment in low carbon energies or face an increasing backlash that could threaten their long-term profits and social acceptance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday. In a report with the World Economic Forum presented in Davos, the IEA said oil and gas companies face a critical challenge as the world increasingly adopts clean energy transitions to curb global warming. Around 15per cent of global energy-related emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers, the IEA said. Energy-related green house gas emissions rose to a record high in 2018. The Paris-based agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy issues, said oil and gas companies are facing increasing demands to explain how they intend to reduce emissions in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option,"" IEA's Executive Director Fatih Birol, said in a statement. The companies are under pressure to cut emissions from their operations and from their products as used by customers, as well as to increase investments in cleaner energies. Targets by oil firms to cut their emissions and switch to cleaner energies vary widely. ""The first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the carbon footprint of their own operations,"" Birol said, adding that a large part of the emissions from the sector can be brought down relatively quickly and easily, such as reducing methane leaks. The IEA said another key move by the sector would be to boost investments in the cleaner fuels – such as hydrogen, biomethane and advanced biofuels. ""Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15per cent of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change,"" it said. So far, average investment by oil and gas companies in non-core areas such as renewables, is still limited to around 1per cent of total capital spending, mostly on solar and wind projects. The IEA said oil and gas companies could play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of renewables given their advanced technologies and deep pockets. The companies could also increase spending on some clean energy technologies – such as carbon capture. (Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"""
'We can't wait': Maldives desperate for funds as islands risk going under,17 Jan 2020 05:26PM (Updated: 17 Jan 2020 05:31PM),Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/maldives-sinking-underwater-wall-funds-climate-change-12274266," NEW DELHI: The tropical Maldives may lose entire islands unless it can quickly access cheap financing to fight the impact of climate change, its foreign minister said. The archipelago's former president Mohamed Nasheed famously held a cabinet meeting underwater to draw attention to submerging land and global warming a decade ago. Yet the Maldives, best known for its white sands and palm-fringed atolls that draw luxury holiday-makers, has struggled to find money to build critical infrastructure like sea-walls. For small states, it is not easy,"" Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid told Reuters in New Delhi. ""By the time the financing is obtained, we may be underwater."" At the UN climate talks in Madrid in December, the Maldives and other vulnerable countries pushed for concrete progress on fresh funding to help them deal with disasters and longer-term damage linked to climate change - but failed. Shahid was hopeful the next round of talks, slated to take place in Glasgow in November, would yield better results. One of the world's lowest-lying countries, more than 80 per cent of the Maldives' land is less than one metre above mean sea levels, making its population of around 530,000 people extremely vulnerable to storm surges, sea swells and severe weather. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami ravaged the Muslim-majority state, causing financial losses of around US$470 million - 62 per cent of GDP - and hitting infrastructure, including its only international airport that was shut for several days. 'WE NEED IT' Two of the country's main industries - tourism and fishing - are heavily dependent on coastal resources, and most settlements and critical infrastructure is concentrated along the coast. In 2014, more than 100 of the archipelago's inhabited islands were already reporting erosion, and around 30 islands are identified as severely eroded. The Maldives spends around US$10 million annually for coastal protection works, but will need up to US$8.8 billion in total to shield all of its inhabited islands, according to a 2016 estimate by its environment ministry. ""In order to protect the islands, we need to start building sea walls,"" Shahid said. ""It's expensive, but we need it. We can't wait until all of them are being taken away."" The United Nations has created a pot to help developing nations, called the Green Climate Fund, which has already approved nearly US$24 million in funding to the Maldives, according to its website. Some individual nations have also offered help, including Japan which contributed to a sea wall round the Maldives' capital Male. Shahid did not specify where his government was pushing for more funding. However, Environment Minister Hussain Rasheed Hassan said recently his country would have to turn to banks given inadequate funding elsewhere despite the fact small nations like his were paying the price for the developed world's pollution. ""We have to beg some of these (big) emitters to provide money for us. Is that fair?"" he said."""

That is the same as the annual mean temperature in 2016 and 0.9 degrees Celsius higher than the 1981 to 2010 long-term average.   Last year was also “particularly dry”, with “below average annual total rainfall” at most places across the island, making it the third driest year ever recorded since 1869 when rainfall records began, said MSS. For example, 1368mm of rainfall was recorded at Changi climate station, 37 per cent below the 1981 to 2010 long-term average. At 27.94 degrees Celsius, the mean temperature for 2010 to 2019 surpassed the previous warmest decade from 2009 to 2018, said MSS in a media release. Temperature records started in 1929. Above-average temperatures were also recorded in all months of 2019, with August and September breaking records for those months. Contributing to 2019’s higher temperatures was the development of one of the strongest, positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events since the 1960s, which “contributed significantly” to the below-average rainfall and higher temperatures observed, especially during the third quarter, said MSS. A positive IOD typically contributes to drier and warmer conditions over Singapore from June to September. MSS said that these temperature trends are “in general agreement” with the latest World Meteorological Organization Statement on the State of the Global Climate, which confirmed that 2019 was the second warmest year on record globally."

"Hotter temperatures could kill 2,000 more a year in US: Study",,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/hotter-temperatures-could-kill-2-000-more-a-year-in-us-study-12260568," PARIS: A rise in temperature of just two degrees Celsius could lead to an additional 2,100 deaths from injuries every year in the United States, researchers said on Monday (Jan 13), highlighting another danger posed by global warming. Most of the extra fatalities would be men aged 15-34 years due to a heightened risk of drowning and road traffic accidents, with alcohol consumption tending to rise in line with temperatures. Researchers from Britain and the US studied the number of deaths from injuries on a state-by-state basis for every year between 1980 and 2017. The deaths were classed either as accidental - from vehicle crashes, falls, drowning and so on - or intentional, from say assault and suicide. They then tracked unusual temperature changes for each county over the same period and found that deaths from injuries tended to rise during warmer months, particularly in populous southern states such as California, Texas and Florida. The authors of the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, said the findings indicated a strong link between the risk of dying from injury and rising global temperatures triggered by climate change. These new results show how much climate change can affect young people,"" said Majid Ezzati, senior study author and a professor at Imperial College London. ""We need to respond to this threat with better preparedness in terms of emergency services, social support and health warnings."" Data from the National Center for Health Statistics analysed by the team showed that in the 1980-2017 period, 4.1 million boys and men died from injury compared with 1.8 million girls and women. They found that warmer temperatures increased the risk of dying from drowning and transport accidents, linked to increased swimming, driving and alcohol intake. They used a statistical model to predict the number of additional deaths in a given year depending on whether temperatures warm 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2 degrees Celsius. These are the temperature targets that nations agreed to work towards in the 2015 Paris climate accord. The team found that 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming would bring an additional 1,600 deaths each year; 2 degrees Celsius of warming would see around 2,100 more. With just 1 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-industrial times so far, Earth has already experienced a cascade of deadly climate-related disasters that kill thousands of people and displace millions each year. President Donald Trump plans to formally pull the US from the Paris deal later this year."""

Swiss climate activists appear in court over Credit Suisse 'tennis' protest,,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/swiss-climate-activists-appear-in-court-over-credit-suisse--tennis--protest-12241612," LAUSANNE, Switzerland: A dozen Swiss climate activists appeared in court on Tuesday after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis inside branches of Credit Suisse bank last year in a stunt intended to highlight the bank's fossil fuel investments and stop people acting like nothing is happening."" The young activists, mostly students, were fined 21,600 Swiss francs (16,973 pounds) for trespassing at Credit Suisse branches in November 2018. Lawyers for the students who are appealing the fine said on Tuesday they were acting as whistleblowers for the climate emergency. ""..It is not enough to just go out on the street or to vote, we must disturb a little bit so people stop acting like nothing is happening,"" Paul Castelain, one of the activists, told Reuters outside a courtroom in Renens, a suburb of Lausanne. Video footage from 2018 shows students dressed in tennis whites playing matches inside Credit Suisse branches in Lausanne and Geneva to underscore Swiss tennis star Roger Federer's sponsorship deal with the bank, which they want him to drop because of its fossil fuels investments. Federer did not immediately respond to a request for comment via his Foundation. Credit Suisse, which had filed charges against the activists, said it respected their cause but deemed their actions unacceptable. ""Combating global warming is important,"" it said in an emailed statement. ""Credit Suisse respects freedom of expression as a fundamental democratic right. to protect its clients, employees and branches, it does not tolerate unlawful attacks on its branches, irrespective of the perpetrators and their motives."" Pressure is rising on Switzerland's financial sector to divest from fossil fuels and thousands of students have marched through Swiss cities in recent months demanding action on climate change. A swing to the left in an October election has boosted their demands. Credit Suisse in December said it will stop financing the development of new coal-fired power plants although activists at the court said this was not enough. It said on Tuesday it was also seeking to align its loan portfolios with objectives set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change. A ruling is due on Jan. 13.

"Businesses using paper instead of plastic? Not necessarily better for the environment, experts say",03 Jan 2020 06:15AM (Updated: 06 Jan 2020 12:10PM),CNA/ja,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/businesses-using-paper-instead-of-plastic-not-necessarily-better-12200916," SINGAPORE: Plastic has developed a bad reputation for the impact it has on the environment. Ocean conservancy groups have estimated that about 8 million tonnes of plastic-based products from bags to bottles and straws end up in the sea each year harming marine life. Plastic items also choke landfills. This has led some businesses in Singapore to switch to alternative materials such as paper for their packaging in the belief that they are better for the environment. At eateries, paper boxes, straws and cups are becoming common. Some retailers are also switching to paper bags to pack items for their customers. Optician Eyewear Optics made the switch in October last year in the interest of the environment, the firm’s director Alex Chong told CNA. “All along, for two decades, we were using plastic, and realised it’s harmful, toxic. We are given a choice - spend a bit more and save the Earth, so we decided to do that,” he said. Plain Vanilla bakery also swapped its plastic straws for metal ones and switched to paper cups lined with polylactic acid (PLA), a plant-based plastic alternative. But some experts say that packaging products made from paper are not necessarily more eco-friendly. They are in fact more resource intensive to produce. PAPER BAGS GET CONTAMINATED EASILY Environmental expert and founder of non-profit group Plastic-Lite Singapore Ms Aarti Giri said: “Plastic seems to have become the punching bag in society.” But paper bags are likely to fill up a landfill faster as they take up more space, she added. The use of paper also leads to deforestation, one of the primary causes of climate change, Ms Giri said. Mr Liow Chean Siang, head of environmental certifications at the Singapore Environment Council, said that even if paper products like bags are “100 per cent recyclable”, once they are contaminated by items such as food, they will need to be disposed of as general waste. “Depending on the degree of contamination, the full contents of the blue recycling bins may be unfit for recycling and require incineration as general waste,” he said. “Paper bags are generally heavier than plastic bags. This increases their carbon footprint in transportation. The paper bags have to be reused at least a few times to be more environmentally friendly than plastic bags. Thus, if the paper bag becomes a single-use one, its environmental footprint might be bigger,” Mr Liow said. According to a life cycle assessment of grocery carrier bags"" report published by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency last year, common supermarket plastic bags ""are the carriers providing the overall lowest environmental impact"" even when they are not reused. A paper bag would need to be reused up to 43 times before having a net environmental benefit, as opposed to the common plastic bag that needs to be reused once to have the same benefit. However, reusing these paper bags can be challenging as they tend to tear, the experts said. NO FACILITIES HERE FOR BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCTS Some firms pride themselves in using biodegradable paper products, which by definition are capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms. They see that as an eco-friendly solution. However, such items have no benefit for the environment in Singapore’s context, the experts said. “It doesn’t make much difference in Singapore that paper products are biodegradable when most of the waste is incinerated,” said co-founder of zero-waste store Florence Tay. She explained that biodegradable paper breaks down in very specific conditions when mixed with other materials, which means that left in a landfill, they will not decompose. They will likely need to be broken down in a facility, which Singapore does not have, she said. On the other hand, standard paper cups and boxes are typically lined with plastic and therefore neither recyclable nor compostable. PLA-LINED PRODUCTS COME WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS While polylactic acid-lined products may appear to be a better solution, Ms Giri said that they present their own problems. PLA is derived from renewable resources such as corn, tapioca and sugarcane. ""Corn is commonly used, and because it is modified to be hardy, higher quantities of fertilisers and chemical pesticides tend to be used during their growth which results in water and soil pollution,"" she said. Ms Giri said the PLA industry may worsen another urgent problem- food shortage, because PLA is usually cultivated on land that could be better used to grow food. ""Agricultural land has always been a very precious commodity, more so now, especially now as we may be seeing more acute food shortages worldwide stemming from global warming, she said. ""It's like a soothing balm but the wound stemming from our single-use or disposable lifestyle may not really heal,"" Ms Giri said. When asked why Plain Vanilla settled on PLA-lined paper cups, chief executive Vanessa Kenchington said: “Of all the available materials available in the Singapore market now, PLA is the most environmentally friendly option material that meets our requirements.”   She added that the firm did thorough research and spoke to people in the single-use food packaging industry to understand its options before committing to PLA-lined paper cups in February this year. Another factor the firm had to consider was that a water-resistant lining is required for cups to hold liquids, Ms Kenchington said. The PLA-lined cups cost almost double that of the plastic cups the eatery previously used. The firm also adopts other eco-friendly practices such as using beeswax wrap instead of cling wrap to store food. ""We have learnt that often the best we can do to be environmentally responsible is to go with the lesser of the two available evils,and at the moment, this means that we cannot fully close the loop due to the lack of existing infrastructure in this regard,"" she said. While businesses want to show that they are doing something good for the environment, the solution does not lie with choosing one material over another, experts said. They should avoid single-use items altogether in favour of reusables, added the experts. Businesses can start making their customers question their need for a bag regardless of what material it is made of, suggested Ms Tay. ""Instead of asking if customers need a bag, they could suggest that they put the item in their own bag."""""
"Oil climbs on US-China trade optimism, Middle East tensions",,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/oil-climbs-on-us-china-trade-optimism--middle-east-tensions-12226554," SEOUL: Oil prices rose on the first trading day of 2020 as warming trade relations between the United States and China eased demand concerns, and rising tensions in the Middle East raised worries about supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures , were up 21 cents, or 0.3per cent, to 66.21 a barrel by 0130 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 21 cents, or 0.3per cent, at US$61.27 per barrel. Oil markets were closed on Wednesday for New Year's Day. Both benchmarks ended higher in 2019, posting their biggest annual gains since 2016, buoyed at the end of the year by a thaw in the prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - and a deeper output cut pledged by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. Oil remains supported by the back-burner trade truce and the uptick in political unrest in Iraq,"" said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader. Geopolitical risks remain in the Middle East after U.S air strikes against the Iran-backed Katib Hezbollah militia group over the weekend. Protesters, angry at the air strikes, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday, although they withdrew after U.S. deployed extra troops. In 2020, Brent is forecast to average US$63.07 a barrel, up from December's estimate of US$62.50, while WTI is forecast to average US$57.70 a barrel, up from December's estimate of US$57.30, as the OPEC-led supply cuts and the expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal boosted analysts' views on the prospects for the year, a Reuters poll showed. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. January also marks the start of the deeper output cuts by OPEC and its partners, including Russia. OPEC and its allies have agreed to cut a further of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, on top of their previous cut of 1.2 million bpd that started on Jan. 1 a year ago. A fall in U.S. crude inventories last week also supported prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.8 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 27, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 3.2 million barrels, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) released on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Friday as the release has been delayed by two days by the New Year's holiday.

Commentary: Things you love that are being wrecked by climate change,02 Jan 2020 06:25AM (Updated: 02 Jan 2020 06:30AM),CNA/el(sl),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-global-warming-effect-impact-extreme-weather-fire-12220232," CANBERRA: There are so many stories flying around about the horrors already being wrought by climate change, you’re probably struggling to keep up. The warnings have been there for decades but still there are those who deny it. So perhaps it’s timely to look at how climate change is affecting you, by wrecking some of the things you love. 1. HOLIDAYS We often choose holiday destinations with weather in mind. Sadly, climate change may see your usual destinations become less inviting, and maybe even disappear entirely. But there’s more to think about than your favourite beach retreat being drowned, or the Great Barrier Reef decaying before you see it. Now we have to worry that “extreme weather events pose significant risks to travellers”. The warnings here range from travel disruption, such as delayed flights due to storms, to severe danger from getting caught in cyclones, floods or snowstorms. Simply getting where you need to go could become an adventure holiday in itself, but not a fun one. 2. WILDLIFE There are more and more examples of animals falling victim to extreme weather events induced by climate change, such as the horrific mass “cremations” of koalas in the path of recent Australian bush fires or bats dropping dead during heatwaves.   On top of that, news of the latest climate-related animal extinctions are becoming as common as reports of politicians doing nothing about it. 3. HISTORY AND HERITAGE The Italian city of Venice recently experienced its worst flooding since the mid-1960s, and the local mayor clearly connected this with climate change. Aside from the human calamity unfolding there, we are seeing one of Europe’s most amazing and unique cities and a World Heritage site devastated before our eyes. Climate change threatens more than 13,000 archaeological sites in North America alone if sea levels rise by 1m. That goes up to more than 30,000 sites if sea levels rise by 5m. UNESCO is worried that climate change also threatens underwater heritage sites, such as ruins and shipwrecks. For example, rising salinity and warming waters increases ship-worm populations that consume wooden shipwrecks in the Baltic sea. 4. SNOW SPORTS Warming temperatures have already had negative impacts on the US snow sports industry since at least 2001. In Australia, ski resorts are expected to see significant drops in snow fall by 2040 and, as temperatures warm, they will be unable to compensate for this by snow-making, because it doesn’t work if ambient temperatures are too high.   Perhaps recent efforts to make artificial snow will give us a few more years on the slopes, but I’m not holding my breath. 5. SPORTS AND EXERCISE It’s not just snow sports that will be affected. As temperatures warm, simply being outside in some parts of the world will not only be less pleasant, but more harmful, causing greater risk of heat stress doing any sports or exercise. That also means lower incentives for – and greater difficult in undertaking – incidental exercise, such as walking to the bus stop. 6. COFFEE As the climate changes, your coffee hits will probably become rarer and more expensive, too. A report by the Climate Institute in 2016 suggested coffee production could drop by 50 per cent by 2050. Given how rapidly negative climate predictions have been updated in the three years since, this might now be considered optimistic. Yikes. 7. HEALTH As the climate changes, the health of your children, your parents and your grandparents will be at greater risk through increases in air pollution, heatwaves and other factors.   It can be heartening to see the strong, intelligent and positive action being taken by the world’s youth in response to the lack of climate action by many governments. But the fact that this is a result of a literal existential crisis becoming a normal part of everyday life for young people is utterly horrifying. 8. HOMES The recent bush fires in Australia and the United States reveal how dramatic and destructive the effects climate change can be to where you live. Hundreds of houses have already burned down in Australia this fire season. Fires are getting more frequent and more ferocious. The seasonal windows where we safely used controlled burning to clear bushfire fuel are shrinking. It’s not only harder to fight fires when they happen, it’s becoming harder to prevent them as well. Fires aren’t the only threat to homes. All around the planet, more and more houses are being destroyed by rising seas and increasingly wild storms, all thanks to climate change. 9.WINE Still not convinced climate change is wrecking things you love? What if I told you it’s even coming for your wine? Less water, soil degradation and higher temperatures earlier in the season all lead to dramatic negative effects on grapes and wine-making.   One small upside is that disruption to traditional wine growing regions is creating opportunities to develop new wine growing areas. But there is no reason to believe these areas will maintain stable grape growing conditions as climate change progresses. WHAT NOW? It’s easy to be sad. But to change our trajectory, it’s better to be mad. In the words of that great English singer songwriter John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), “anger is an energy”. So maybe use this list as motivation to think, talk and act. Use it as fuel to make small, large or a combination of changes. Share your concerns, share your solutions, and do this relentlessly. What’s happening right now is huge, overwhelming, and also inevitable without concerted action. There’s no sugar-coating it: climate change is wrecking the things we love. Time to step it up a notch.

Commentary: The Singapore economy in 2020 - stabilisation or more uncertainties on the horizon?,01 Jan 2020 06:42AM (Updated: 01 Jan 2020 06:50AM),CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-economy-outlook-2020-labour-market-sectors-12222200," SINGAPORE: 2019 has been a roller-coaster ride for financial markets and the global economy including Asia. Geopolitics has loomed large over business sentiments. The year has been driven by US President Donald Trump’s frequent tweets, bouts of market volatility and geopolitical tensions on both the trade and technology fronts, the never-ending drama called Brexit, and much hand-wringing over China’s ongoing growth slowdown, among others. Despite initial market fears about a US recession, the US economy escaped a contraction. Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, had ridden quickly to the rescue with interest rate cuts and liquidity provisions. Hence, notwithstanding the economic uncertainties and bouts of risk-aversion, financial markets still performed fairly well as illustrated by the S&P 500’s continued surge. At home, the Singapore economy managed to avert a technical recession in the third quarter of 2019, albeit with full-year growth likely to come in at the lower end of the official growth forecast range. THE OUTLOOK FOR SINGAPORE IN 2020 Looking ahead, there are some tentative green shoots on the macroeconomic front, including favourable borrowing conditions and a slightly stronger outlook for emerging markets. But we should remain cautious not to count the chickens before they hatch, given that many factors, such as the US-China bilateral relationship, can turn in an instance. The Singapore economy may eke out modestly improved growth prospects of 1 to 2 per cent year-on-year in 2020, versus a subdued 0.5 to 1.0 per cent forecast range for 2019.   This assumes that the global trade tensions do not escalate further from here and the manufacturing and trade outlook sees a modicum of stabilisation. Moreover, the challenges ahead for the Singapore economy over the next few years may be more structural and difficult to navigate. Take for instance, climate change, which has manifested in fires, floods and global warming, and will require significant investments for countries adapting to a changed environment. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had earlier highlighted the need for US$100 billion for the Singapore economy to prepare for rising sea levels at the National Day Rally in 2019. The greying of the Singapore population with attendant health, retirement and housing planning needs could also strain fiscal resources over the long term. The rise of the gig economy also poses fresh challenges for policymakers who now have to think about how to strengthen job security, plan for medium-term career development and approach retirement needs for workers in this new economy. THE BIG RISKS FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT The good news is major economies appear to be navigating global economic headwinds well thus far, although Eurozone growth remains sluggish for now. That said, the US is heading into an election cycle and if the impeachment process against incumbent president Trump is any guide, the noise level is likely to remain elevated in 2020. In Asia, regional economies are carefully treading the bifurcation of manufacturing supply and trading chains as businesses adopt a “China plus one” approach to avoid US-China trade tariffs.   The biggest risk for the Singapore economy remains the fragility of the external environment and the prospect of anaemic global growth amid uncertainties pertaining to US-China tensions beyond trade, Brexit, China’s slowdown, and geopolitical hotspots (such as the Hong Kong unrest) which could continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence. CHALLENGES TO SPECIFIC SECTORS Sectoral challenges remain mixed for the Singapore economy. The services and construction sectors are likely to provide the bulwark for 2020 growth, even if manufacturing sector stages a modest recovery. Manufacturing, especially electronics, has been suffering a global demand slowdown, coupled with the wax and wane of the US-China trade war that has impacted both business and consumer confidence. While there were tentative signs of a bottoming- out in the middle of 2019, a quick V-shaped upturn remains elusive for now, although there are hopes that the 5G implementation will lend a helping hand going forward. There are also hopes the impending conclusion of a US-China Phase 1 trade deal heralds a more reconciliatory trade relationship. Still, domestic demand conditions may remain subdued due to the lack of fresh growth catalysts. The outlook for cyclical industries, like retail, remain challenging due to a combination of supply-side factors like high operating costs including rents and the ongoing manpower crunch, whereas the demand side is likely restrained by potential belt-tightening in households. SINGAPORE’S LABOUR MARKET WILL REMAIN RESILIENT The domestic labour market had stayed relatively resilient over the course of 2019. Although the overall unemployment rate had crept up to a 10-year high of 2.3 per cent, retrenchments for the 12 months to September 2019 was actually lower at 10,490, compared to the same period a year before (11,900) and in 2017 (16,480).   Hiring intentions have turned more cautious, which explains in part why resident wage growth for the first nine months of 2019 had come down slightly to 3.3 per cent, down from 3.7 per cent for the same period a year ago. However, looking ahead, the services sector will have to grapple with the Dependency Ratio Ceiling cut from 40 per cent to 38 per cent from Jan 1, 2020 for the proportion of foreign workers on work permits or S Passes, with a further cut to 35 per cent from Jan 1, 2021. This may buffer against any softening of the domestic labour market amid an expected lacklustre growth recovery environment in 2020. Growth industries likely to offer employment opportunities include healthcare, education services, information and communications (ICT), and finance and insurance. The unemployment rate may hover around the 2.3 to 2.5 per cent in the interim, but should avoid the sharp spikes seen in the global financial crisis back in 2009. The biggest challenge for labour remains keeping up with advances in technology. In the medium term, with the advent of the Internet of Things, automation, and the employment of artificial intelligence, Singapore is expected to see the largest disruption in its workforce among ASEAN countries. Singapore may see a faster and more widespread digital transformation compared to its ASEAN peers. Major upskilling or reskilling will be needed for the labour force to stay relevant and fill new jobs created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is likely to remain a key focus for policymakers. EXPECTATIONS FOR POLICY SUPPORT AND BUDGET 2020 There is space for a stronger fiscal response at the upcoming 2020 Budget, after a more accommodative monetary policy in 2019. Market attention is increasingly focused on what is touted to be a pre-election budget. Looking around the region, Singapore would not be alone if it unveils a more expansionary budget. Countries around the region have announced proactive fiscal policy support including China, South Korea, Thailand and India. Japan has announced a stimulus package amounting to some 13 trillion yen (S$160 billion), while Hong Kong has announced waves of fiscal packages to tackle its recession.   Many Singaporeans will look to Budget 2020 for aid for workers and companies. To better assist displaced workers and SMEs to ride out these challenging times, it may be timely to top up the SkillsFuture Credit scheme from the initial S$500 per Singaporean and offer more work transition support by scaling up the Professional Conversion Programmes. For SMEs, greater assistance in terms of enterprise capability building, innovation and internationalisation efforts in light of the global trade tensions will be likely. We should also expect Budget 2020 to reflect a focus on medium-term priorities such as healthcare, education, security (including cybersecurity and food security), productivity improvements and environmental and financial sustainability. Budget 2020 may also provide greater clarity on how to fund the S$100 billion to combat climate change. Aside from any stimulus package to tackle concerns over the state of the economy and measures to support businesses, many will also look to Budget 2020 for support for households. There had been strong hints of a GST offset package in the offing. Without a specific timeline on the actual implementation of the planned GST hike from 7 to 9 per cent, it may be premature to speculate on the actual quantum of the 2020 GST offset package. The focus of social programmes will likely target low-income households and seniors and costs of living concerns. For the new year in 2020, one has to be thankful that many much touted external downside growth risks did not materialise, and look forward with an air of cautious optimism that the global and regional economy will improve from a very volatile 2019.

In an interview with BBC radio's Today programme, for which she was the guest editor on Monday, Thunberg also said she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life. A video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a death stare"" at a UN climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agrement on global warming.   Asked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Thunberg said: ""Honestly, I don't think I would have said anything because obviously he's not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me? ""So I probably wouldn't have said anything, I wouldn't have wasted my time,"" she said. This month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Thunberg ""a brat"". Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem. ""Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don't mean anything,"" she said. ""I guess of course it means something - they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don't want - but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat."" Thunberg came to world attention when she began a grassroots campaign aged 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change. PRAISE FROM DAVID ATTENBOROUGH Thunberg, who was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering. She also spoke in Monday's BBC programme with veteran British broadcaster David Attenborough, telling him how his nature documentaries had inspired her.   ""You have aroused the world,"" the 93-year-old Attenborough told Thunberg in reply, adding that she had achieved things ""that many of us who have been working on the issue for 20 years have failed to do"". Her father Svante Thunberg, also interviewed for the BBC programme, said she had dealt very well with ""the fake news, all the things that people try to fabricate about her, the hate that that generates"" while in the global media limelight. ""Quite frankly, I don't know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious,"" he said.   The teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid. ""I hope I won't have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don't have to be a climate activist any more,"" she said on Monday, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August. ""I just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager."""""
2019 was hottest year on record for Russia,30 Dec 2019 07:44PM (Updated: 30 Dec 2019 07:50PM),AFP/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2019-was-hottest-year-on-record-for-russia-12220778," MOSCOW: This year was the hottest ever registered in Russia, the country's weather chief said on Monday (Dec 30), as climate change pushes global temperatures to record highs. This year in Russia was the hottest for the entire period of instrumental observations,"" the head of the Gidromedtsentr weather service, Roman Vilfand, told Russian news agencies. He said Moscow's average temperature for 2019 had hit 7.6-7.7 degrees Celsius, beating the previous record by 0.3 degrees. Weather records have been kept since 1879 in Moscow and since 1891 in Russia as a whole. Global warming has sent temperatures rising around the world, with the United Nations saying earlier this month that 2019 was on course to be one of the three hottest years on record. Known for its notoriously harsh winters, Moscow has seen its warmest December in a century this year. While some flurries fell on Monday, the Russian capital - normally covered with a blanket of snow by mid-December - saw a largely snowless and cloudy last month of the year. The city's ski resorts were closed and spring buds were beginning to show on trees - three or more months too early. Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been reluctant to acknowledge the link between human activity and global warming. At his traditional year-end annual news conference earlier this month, Putin insisted that ""nobody knows"" the causes of climate change. But he acknowledged the consequences of global warming could be catastrophic for a country that is one of the world's biggest producers of carbon fuel and with a fifth of its land within the Arctic circle. Putin said that the rate of warming for Russia was 2.5 per cent higher than elsewhere on the planet. And ""for our country, this process is very serious"", he said."""
BoE's Carney says finance must act faster on climate change,30 Dec 2019 05:25PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/boe-s-carney-says-finance-must-act-faster-on-climate-change-12220434," LONDON: Financial services have been too slow to cut investment in fossil fuels, a delay that could lead to a sharp increase in global temperatures, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in an interview broadcast on Monday. Carney, due to become the United Nations' special envoy for climate change next year when he steps down from the bank, told BBC radio that global warming could render the assets of many financial companies worthless. Carney cited pension fund analysis that showed the policies of companies pointed to global warming of 3.7 to 3.8 degrees Celsius, compared with the 1.5-degree target outlined in the Paris Agreement on climate change. The concern is whether we will spend another decade doing worthy things but not enough... and we will blow through the 1.5C mark very quickly,"" Carney said in a radio program guest edited by teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. ""As a consequence, the climate will stabilize at the much higher level."" Carney said the financial sector had made a lot of progress in disclosing the risks to their assets from climate change, but he warned that progress was not fast enough. He called on political leaders to effect change today and avoid selective information and spin. ""To deliver, there needs to be shared understanding about what's necessary. it is reasonable for there to be debates at the margin about where does the role of the state stop and what's the role of markets,"" Carney said. He said there would need to be a mix of public investment and change driven by financial markets because of their power to reflect judgments about the future value of assets in a world affected by climate change. Earlier this month, the BoE said Britain's top banks and insurers should be tested together for the first time in 2021 to quantify the potential financial damage from climate change on their businesses.

From skincare to makeup: The biggest beauty trends that defined the 2010s,30 Dec 2019 06:30AM (Updated: 30 Dec 2019 07:00AM),CNA/yy,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/beauty-skincare-makeup-trends-12205182," Change is a constant – that’s a fact – and 10 years worth of it represent quite a substantial amount of developments to look back on. A lot of it can be found within the beauty industry, which has made a significantly big shift in just about every aspect this past decade. There’s the exciting and the surprising, a whole lot of crazy, as well as plenty of upgrades in terms of beauty technology. More importantly, the 2010s have brought about a change in consumers’ mindset toward beauty – as we become more knowledgeable about the industry and the products we put on our skin, we want our skincare and cosmetics not just to be more safe and effective, but also to be more environmentally friendly. Which trends have gotten us into buying frenzies, and which ones should stay or be tossed away? Let us look back and review the happenings that have defined our beauty tastes and routines. THE KOREAN WAVE A post shared by Sulwhasoo Singapore (@sulwhasoo.singapore) on Jul 27, 2019 at 8:00pm PDT The biggest beauty movement to take the world by storm in the last decade is the K-beauty wave. Sheet masks (for the face and various parts of the body), the 10-step skincare routine as well as a plethora of products that the rest of the world had never seen or tried before – like the cushion compact, sleeping mask, as well as weird skincare ingredients like snail slime and donkey’s milk – are just some of the things it brought with it. The biggest beauty movement to take the world by storm in the last decade is, of course, the K-beauty wave. These Korean trends may no longer be hot news anymore, but they are still going on strong and have also left evidence of their influence on Western cosmetic brands, which have developed their own versions of some of these Korean products. THE GADGET AGE A post shared by FOREO (@foreo) on Dec 21, 2019 at 1:09pm PST Technology changes everything, not least the way we go about our beauty routine. Fingers, it seems, no longer suffice as application and blending tools when it comes to putting on skincare and makeup. Instead, a nifty gadget or two are now required if you wish to improve how these products perform on your skin. From microcurrent and jade facial rollers to LED light skincare devices, there’s an implement to suit every need and budget. These promise a variety of benefits – they can soothe skin and boost the penetration of skincare products, firm and tighten skin or even target acne problems. A nifty gadget or two are now required if you wish to improve how these products perform on your skin. Makeup application tools, particularly those used for foundation, have gotten more advanced than ever before. Ye olde wedge sponge may still be able to accomplish the job but the finish that it gives is nothing like the flawless results that a Beauty Blender, vibrating sponge applicator or Artis brush can give you. CONTOURING CRAZE A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 17, 2019 at 3:18pm PST Thanks to social media and the advent of “Instagram makeup”, contouring and highlighting have both grown into huge trends and become essential steps in every beauty influencer’s LOTD. The trend speedily opened up a whole new product category in beauty – suddenly, cosmetics brands were coming up with all manner of highlighting powders and contouring sticks, not to mention handy palettes combining a variety of these. These makeup tricks for helping celebrities look better on screen actually do work like a charm. Some credit (or blame) the Kardashian and Jenner clans for starting this potentially streaky-looking trend, but the fact is that contouring and highlighting have actually been around for quite a while – seen as early as the 1930s on film stars like Marlene Dietrich. These makeup tricks for helping celebrities look better on screen actually do work like a charm, provided you don’t use them with too heavy a hand (as seen in many an influencer’s dramatic demonstration on Instagram). Remember that you are repurposing these shading techniques for real life and not for movie cameras. MATTE POUTS A post shared by Armani Beauty (@armanibeauty) on Dec 21, 2019 at 1:59am PST The matte lip is not a new thing, but it definitely defined the makeup look of the 2010s in an unprecedented way. It also paved the way for the arrival of a new product that is both loved and hated in equal parts – the liquid lipstick. This super-matte lip product gives full-impact, budge-proof colour in a few swipes but also tended to annihilate all moisture in the lips. Matte lips are likely to stick around albeit in a velvet, demi-matte finish that is more wearable. Even so, nothing stopped it from becoming a best-selling makeup product – just ask Kylie Jenner, who built her multi-million-dollar beauty empire on her liquid lip kits that kept on selling out when the first batches hit online stores. The liquid lipstick is still around, and, thankfully, is now available in formulas that are more forgiving on a dry pout. As we go into a new decade, matte lips are likely to stick around, albeit in a velvet, demi-matte finish that is more wearable and can be delivered via both a liquid or regular lipstick. SEMI-PERMANENT MAKEUP A post shared by Erabelle Singapore (@erabellesg) on Nov 12, 2018 at 2:25am PST One global trend that has really made its presence felt in Singapore in recent years is semi-permanent makeup. It’s not just eyebrow embroidery or microblading that can be done these days; one can practically get a full face of “makeup” that won’t fade or wash off at the end of the day – eyeliner, lip colour, even blush and a foundation-like skin base. They are not permanent and will fade in a matter of months, which means they aren’t irreversible should you decide on a change. Of course, while these new techniques are all essentially a form of tattooing, they aren’t like the permanent eyebrow tattooing of yore with pigments that fade to a ghastly green. Instead, they produce a natural finish, as well as offer a customisable intensity. Best of all, they are not permanent and will fade in a matter of months, which means they aren’t irreversible should you decide on a change. It’s easy to see why semi-permanent makeup is so popular now – not only is it a great time-saver, it also offers those who are hopeless at applying makeup a way to hold onto expertly made-up brows, eyes or lips for months on end. IN-YOUR-FACE HAIR A post shared by Evolve Salon (@evolve_salon) on Jan 31, 2018 at 3:32am PST It began with full-on peroxide-blonde and then morphed into a bizarre multicoloured rainbow trend. Then came pink, purple and grey, as well as ombre colouring techniques involving one or more of these outre shades for the hair. Never had a hair trend been so OTT and what’s more unusual is that it seems that the whole world is embracing it. We aren’t quite sure what to make of it – a bold hair colour change may be fun and super eye-catching, but certain colours are simply not work- or school-appropriate and, worse still, have turned many a head of hair into a dry and wiry mess with the damage caused by extensive bleaching. The health of your hair should be your top priority, because absolutely no colour will look good on hair that’s frizzy. Our vote goes to a more subtle approach – ashy-brown tones can be much more attractive and are far easier to maintain than a crazy-bright colour that leaches out of hair in barely two weeks. More importantly, the health of your hair should be your top priority, because absolutely no colour will look good on hair that’s frizzy. THE CLEAN MOVEMENT A post shared by Fresh (@freshbeauty) on Oct 1, 2019 at 7:06am PDT Ten years ago, no one really questioned what actually went into their skincare products as long as they felt good, smelled good and did what they’re supposed to do. So what if there were a bunch of words we didn’t recognise in the ingredient list? There wasn’t any information out there about them; besides, the general assumption back then was that no beauty company would put anything unsafe into the products that we are using. Fast-forward to 2020 and we now know the truth. Parabens, phthalates, sulphates and synthetic fragrances – some of the most widely used chemical ingredients in the beauty trade – could be responsible for irritating our skin or, worse still, may cause more severe health problems down the road. Parabens, phthalates, sulphates and synthetic fragrances could be responsible for irritating our skin or, worse still, may cause more severe health problems down the road. The rise of clean beauty came about with increasing levels of awareness about these harmful ingredients, opening up a new branch in the industry that is largely made up of smaller-scale brands producing nasties-free skincare. Of course, not all synthetic ingredients are harmful. At the same time, it is difficult to formulate some products or ensure their longevity without the use of certain essential synthetic ingredients. The key is in understanding which are the ones that are skin-friendly and safe for use. But while there are still points to be debated here, one thing is clear – clean beauty is here to stay and any beauty company that is seriously thinking about the future must have a foot in it. SUSTAINABLE BEAUTY A post shared by Drunk Elephant (@drunkelephant) on Dec 21, 2019 at 9:05am PST Global warming is all too real, and the beauty industry has a significant role to play in containing environmental damage. While efforts are still not as widely and speedily taken as they should be by the industry at large, it’s heartening to see more beauty brands going out of their way to ensure that their business practices are as sustainable as they can be. Global warming is all too real, and the beauty industry has a significant role to play in containing environmental damage. Packaging, for one, has started to change for the benefit of the environment – glass, instead of plastic; simpler packaging that does away with multiple layers of cardboard; as well as single-material bottles that create ease for recycling. Some brands are even offering perks to customers who bring in their empty product containers for recycling. Other brands have begun to look into sustainable and ethical sourcing of ingredients so that we may enjoy guilt-free beauty. Is it a tall order or a challenge that can actually be accomplished? The next 10 years will reveal the answer and hopefully get us much closer to being thoroughly environmentally friendly."
"Commentary: Despite pressures against it, truth survived 2019",28 Dec 2019 06:20AM (Updated: 28 Dec 2019 06:30AM),Project Syndicate/ml,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/2019-review-is-truth-dead-12214584," LONDON – “Truthiness,” a concept coined by the American comedian Stephen Colbert, involves saying things that you want to believe are true even if there is no factual evidence to support these assertions. And without doubt, truthiness has had a great run in 2019 – from US President Donald Trump’s Washington, to the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom, to events in Asia. This disturbing trend was partly reflected in Time magazine’s choice of candidates for its 2019 Person of the Year. The shortlist of five included Trump, who, although he did not win the prize of seeing his picture on Time’s cover, exemplifies the political triumph of today’s ubiquitous mendacity. In the opposite corner were two other candidates: the whistleblower who exposed Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine’s president for political gain, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who presided over the chamber’s recent vote to impeach the president. TIME FOR TRUTH The two remaining contenders also represented old-fashioned honesty and political courage. The winner was Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate-change campaigner. Some patronize her, while others reject her arguments. But she represents the concerns of those who will inherit the future. Moreover, what Thunberg says bears the imprimatur of most of the world’s climate scientists. She wants world leaders to act to save the planet before it is too late. On a recent visit to Australia – first to Melbourne, and then to Sydney – I was surprised at the disconnect between the government’s position on climate change and the bushfires that are devastating New South Wales.   Almost 30 years ago, as Britain’s environment minister, I chaired the London conference that toughened up the Montreal Protocol in order to prevent further ozone depletion. The Australian government was one of that initiative’s major supporters, which was hardly surprising given that the hole in the ozone layer above Australia was expanding at the time. With forest fires now ringing Sydney, it is surprising that the current government still seems so complacent about climate change. In fact, some of its members sound as though they think global warming is all a hoax. PRO-DEMOCRACY Rounding out Time’s shortlist were Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaigners, who were saluted for protests that have been ongoing for more than six months. Quite apart from the demonstrators’ bravery and the principles they represent (most of the time peacefully), there are three reasons to see their actions as blows for the truth.   First, the demonstrators are correct to argue that the Chinese communist regime has reneged on the promises made to Hong Kong when China regained sovereignty over the city in 1997. Hong Kong’s citizens were assured that they would have a high degree of local autonomy and would continue living in a free society under the rule of law. But the city’s government has proved to be a subservient mouthpiece of the regime in Beijing. In practice, that means it does nothing to address the demonstrators’ legitimate grievances about the way they are governed and the lack of progress (despite many promises) with regard to democratic accountability in the last 20 years. Second, in addition to other complaints, the demonstrators have been incensed by the growing incidence of police brutality during the protests. There also have been clear breaches of humanitarian law in the treatment of health workers who were prevented from assisting injured demonstrators. The Hong Kong government says that it already has an adequate system for handling complaints against the police.   But that claim has been exposed as nonsense by the resignation of a panel of outside experts who were brought in to assess whether existing institutions dealing with police conduct were fit for purpose. Clearly, the panel’s members did not think that they could carry out their properly assigned task. STANDING IN SUPPORT Finally, Hong Kong’s citizens stood behind the demonstrators despite the violent behaviour of an extreme fringe as the protests continued. Although this minority perhaps was provoked by the government’s failure to engage with them or with the majority of entirely peaceful campaigners, their violence was and is unacceptable. Some – including China’s communist regime and its supporters in Hong Kong – believed that the violence would undermine public support for the demonstrators’ demands. Far from it. Hong Kong’s district council elections in November resulted in a sweeping victory for pro-democracy candidates, proving emphatically that there was no silent majority in support of the city’s government. On the contrary, the majority of not-so-silent citizens were in favour of democracy and the rule of law. Hong Kong’s demonstrators thus were on the side of truth: their city really did want to defend cherished values and hold its government and police to account. As we move into 2020, however, I feel very strongly that the demonstrators would be wise to try to end the violence and rely on the visible strength of their support to make their case. I still believe that, over time, the pressure of strong sentiment in Hong Kong and around the world is more likely to shift the totalitarian regime in Beijing than fighting the police and causing property damage are. Truthiness cast a dark shadow over public life in 2019, and probably will continue to do so next year. But fortunately for those who care about both democracy and the planet, the actual truth remains a powerful force. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and a former EU commissioner for external affairs, is Chancellor of the University of Oxford."

Singapore taps technology to make nature-based climate change solutions more effective | Video,,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-taps-technology-to-make-nature-based-climate-change-12213444,
The year the world woke up to the climate emergency,26 Dec 2019 05:46PM (Updated: 26 Dec 2019 05:50PM),AFP/ga,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/the-year-the-world-woke-up-to-the-climate-emergency-12212988," PARIS: Schoolchildren skipping class to strike, protests bringing city centres to a standstill: armed with dire warnings from scientists, people around the world dragged the climate emergency into the mainstream in 2019. Spurred on by Swedish wunderkind Greta Thunberg - virtually unknown outside of her homeland a year ago but now a global star nominated for a Nobel prize - millions of young people took part in weekly demonstrations demanding climate action. And, like harbingers of the apocalypse, the Extinction Rebellion movement embarked on a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience that spread worldwide, armed with little more than superglue and the nihilistic motto: When hope dies, action begins.""   Although scientists have warned for decades about the risk to humanity and Earth posed by unfettered burning of fossil fuels, in 2019 - set to be the second hottest year in history - their message seems to have finally hit home. The 2015 Paris agreement saw nations commit to limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as a way of curbing the worst impacts of global warming. A safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius was included as a goal for nations to work towards.   With Earth having already warmed by 1 degree Celsius, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) dropped a bombshell late last year. Its landmark report in October 2018 laid the groundwork for the string of climate shockwaves that rumbled throughout 2019: The world is way off course for 1.5 degrees Celsius, and the difference between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius could be catastrophic. ""The message from scientists was that each half-degree counts,"" said Amy Dahan, a science historian specialising in climate at France's National Centre for Scientific Research. It was a message heard around the world. For Corinne Le Quere, president of France's High Commission for Climate Change and member of Britain's Committee on Climate Change, 2019 was ""something new"". ""I've worked on climate change for 30 years and for 29 of those, as scientists, we've worked unnoticed,"" she told AFP. The IPCC report concluded that global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030 - and reach ""net zero"" by 2050 - to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""It's given us a clear timeline: we have 12 years to act,"" said Caroline Merner, 24, a Canadian member of the Youth4Climate movement. The UN last month said carbon emissions must decline 7.6 per cent annually by 2030 to stand any chance of hitting 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists meanwhile said emissions this year will instead rise 0.6 percent. Despite growing mobilisation and awareness, COP25 - the climate summit in Madrid this month - barely squeezed out compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. ANNUS HORRIBILIS But while society and particularly younger generations appear to have woken up to the threat of climate catastrophe, industry shows little signs of sharing their urgency. Greenhouse gas emissions are once again set to rise in 2019 after hitting a record in 2018, as extreme weather events - made more likely as the planet warms - struck seemingly everywhere this year. Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, typhoon Hagibis in Japan, a deadly, record-breaking heatwave across much of Europe, wildfires in California and eastern Australia, floods in Venice ... the list goes on.   The threat posed by climate change became so stark in 2019 that Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth, decided to move its capital to somewhere that wasn't sinking. ""We're seeing climate change with our own eyes,"" Le Quere said. ""Reality is forcing us to act."" The science came thick and fast this year, with the IPCC releasing two additional special reports on land use and oceans, and another UN body, IPBES, issuing a stunning warning of the threats posed by human activity to the natural world. Faced with an unbreachable body of evidence and mounting pressure from the streets, governments in 2019 started, slowly, to mobilise. A total of 66 nations now have plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The cities of London and Paris declared official ecological and climate emergencies. Yet there are fears meagre progress could be undermined as developing economies appear no closer to ditching fossil fuels and the United States - the largest historic emitter - looks poised to complete its Paris pullout. ""CLIMATE MAKES US EQUAL"" Environmental activism, of course, is nothing new. As Alfredo Jornet, professor at the University of Oslo, pointed out, indigenous peoples ""have been very active for a long time"" in protesting against climate change and deforestation, often to little fanfare. ""It's easy to be worried about the climate when you have money and privilege,"" said Melina Sakiyama, 34, a Brazilian activist. With the deadline for countries' Paris commitments looming, as well as a series of high-profile environment summits in 2020, this year is unlikely to be a one-off in terms of climate action. ""The question is how to mobilise this unrest in a way that can lead us to better, more peaceful, democratic and sustainable societies,"" said Jornet. ""In a sense, climate change makes us all more equal. It makes us more capable of acting together."""""
Australia PM defends coal as climate-fuelled bushfires burn,24 Dec 2019 03:08AM (Updated: 24 Dec 2019 03:10AM),AFP/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-pm-defends-coal-as-climate-fuelled-bushfires-burn-12207680," SYDNEY: Under-fire Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday (Dec 23) rejected calls for reckless"" and ""job-destroying"" cuts to the country's vast coal industry in the face of a deadly climate-fuelled bushfire crisis. Morrison's conservative government has fiercely defended the lucrative coal industry in Australia, which produces a third of global coal exports and provides work in swing electoral districts. ""I am not going to write off the jobs of thousands of Australians by walking away from traditional industries,"" Morrison told the Seven Network, in one of several morning interviews rejecting calls for further action. ""What we won't do is engage in reckless and job-destroying and economy-crunching targets which are being sought,"" he told Channel 9, responding to calls for more climate-friendly policies. Morrison's media blitz came as he sought to limit the political fallout from a much-criticised Hawaiian holiday - taken as bushfires destroyed an area the size of Belgium and unleashed toxic smoke into Australia's major cities. Holiday plans have been hit, with national parks closing camp sites and the main coastal road linking Sydney with southeastern beach towns again shuttered due to the impact of fires. Conditions eased markedly on Monday, but authorities said in the last few days almost 200 homes have been damaged by fires in South Australia and New South Wales. Authorities said little was left of the small town of Balmoral, southwest of Sydney, where 67-year-old artist Steve Harrison told public broadcaster ABC he had been forced to weather the fire from a make-shift kiln. ""I ran to my ute (pickup) but my garden was already on fire, the driveway was on fire, the road was on fire so I couldn't evacuate,"" he said. ""The day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back - a coffin-sized kiln - just big enough for me to crawl inside."" ""I was in there for half an hour while the firestorm went over. It was huge, just glowing orange-red everywhere. Just scary. I was terrified."" A Big Bash League cricket match in the capital Canberra was abandoned at the weekend because of toxic bushfire haze that left Australian Test bowler Peter Siddle needing treatment for smoke inhalation. Adelaide Strikers captain Alex Carey said a doctor assessed Siddle and a couple of others. Siddle returned to Melbourne ""and (is) joining the Australian squad"" for a Boxing Day Test against New Zealand, Carey said. 'RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT' Bushfires occur frequently in Australia, but scientists say several weather phenomena have come together to make this spring-summer bushfire season among the worst on record. Record-low rainfall, record-high temperatures and strong winds have made the situation more combustible, and according to scientists, are influenced by climate change. Morrison has insisted Australia will meet its 2030 emissions targets. ""I'm going to maintain the course of responsible management, responsibly addressing the changes of climate change and responsibly ensuring that we can grow our economy in what is a very tough climate at the moment,"" Morrison told the Seven Network. Australia committed at the 2015 UN climate summit to reduce its emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. However, environmental activists say those targets are not nearly enough to help the world keep global warming at safe levels. Morrison's government has further been criticised for seeking to achieve its 2030 targets by counting credits under a complicated global accounting method, rather than through new reductions. While Australia's national carbon emissions are low compared with major polluters, its fossil fuel exports - mostly coal - account for an estimated seven percent of the world's carbon emissions. The opposition leader, Labour's Anthony Albanese, pilloried Morrison's ""stubbornness"" in refusing ""to change course."" ""People are scared of what is going on around them. And if Mr Morrison thinks that there's nothing to see here, it's because he can't see through the smoke and haze that's been created by these bushfires,"" Albanese said."""
"Climate change, floods and drought: Here’s how badly Singapore could be affected",21 Dec 2019 06:45AM (Updated: 03 Jan 2020 05:57PM),CNA/dp,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/how-badly-climate-change-floods-drought-could-affect-singapore-12202206," SINGAPORE: The official projection, by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore, is that the country could experience a mean sea level rise of up to a metre by 2100. But climate scientist Benjamin Horton thinks Singapore, of all places, should be worried because it could get higher. “What about a high emission (scenario)?” questions the professor at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment. “We’re looking at a full 1.5 metres for Singapore … That’s our best estimate.” To protect residents and infrastructure, he says Singapore must look at an even higher number. “You’d want to know what the extremes are … what the one-in-20 possibility is. We’re looking at greater than 2.5 metres.” The implication is that inland areas as far as Bishan and Toa Payoh could be at risk.   That is how badly climate change could affect the island, even as the government prepares to spend probably S$100 billion over the coming decades to protect Singapore. And as the programme Why It Matters finds out, Singaporeans might see the effects of the climate crisis sooner than they think. (Watch it here.) TIP OF THE ICEBERG The present-day sea level rise of 3.2 millimetres a year is “the fastest … we’ve seen for around six or seven thousand years”, notes Horton. And that does not add up to only six centimetres over the next 20 years. “What you want to think about is totalling that … with an acceleration,” he says. “For Singapore, in the next 20 to 30 years, we’ll get about 20 to 30 cm of sea level rise.” WATCH: Singapore in deep water: A flooded future (3:51)  Singapore is a “hot spot” because the effects of the melting ice at the poles are “amplified in the tropics”. “These ice sheets are massive. Anything that has mass has attraction to it … (As) the ice sheets lose mass, that attraction is diminished and the water flows away,” he points out. “And it goes back to the tropics.” Greenland, if it were all to melt, would raise global sea levels by six metres, while Antarctica has enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 times that. “And all our observations of Antarctica and Greenland are indicating that we’re approaching a tipping point,” he adds.   PERFECT STORM Singapore’s rainfall trend is already enough to cause concern, reckons senior research scientist Muhammad Eeqmal Hassim from the Meteorological Service Singapore. Annual rainfall has trended upwards at a rate of 9 mm per decade from 1980 to last year. “Nine millimetres doesn’t seem a lot, but … we’ve seen an upward trend in terms of the intensity and also the frequency. So heavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent and more severe,” he says. “When it rains, it pours.” He notes that heavy rainfall occurring over a short period is a “key ingredient” for a flash flood, “so with climate change, we can expect more of these events”. Adam Switzer, a principal investigator for NTU’s Earth Observatory of Singapore, is inclined to agree that there is an increased likelihood of inland flooding, especially if such rainfall events coincide with a storm surge.   A storm surge occurs when low atmospheric pressure causes a swell in the ocean and wind blows the water mass against the coastline — which means a “temporary elevation of sea level”. “So we’ll see … up to 30, 40 cm over several hours, moving through the Singapore Strait,” says the associate professor. “You have a baseline of rising sea level, but on top of that, you have these temporary storm surges. This is where you get to the perfect storm.” How often Singapore will experience these perfect storms, however, is a question mark, he acknowledges. “In Southeast Asia in particular, the data gap is so significant that it’s hard to put solid numbers on where we’re going to be in 2050 or 2100.”   EVALUATING THE COSTS NTU’s head of economics, Euston Quah, says “proper data” is also needed to measure, in dollar terms, the damage flooding could cause. Between 2000 and 2015, economic damages from floods were estimated to have exceeded S$32 million. Just the floods in June to July 2010 had cost S$23 million, from 868 insurance claims for business interruptions, property damage and motor vehicle damage. But there is more to measuring damages than that, says the professor of environmental economics. There is a cost to health, including treatment delays caused by traffic congestion; productivity loss is another aspect, for example if people cannot get to work or goods cannot be delivered; and there is lost tourism. Any loss of life must also be factored in, Quah points out, citing a study he and a colleague did in which the valuation of a person’s life here was S$4 million.   There are also intangible costs, such as loss of reputation, lost recreation and the psychological impact on people. “All of these feed back to the economy,” he adds. This is why Singapore is spending S$400 million upgrading and maintaining drains in the next two years, on top of the S$1.8 billion spent since 2011. But care must be taken not to overspend, says Quah, an expert in cost-benefit analysis. “If the cost of damages is S$10 million, (and) let’s say the cost of (the control measures) is S$12 million, then it makes no sense.” He calls for a “more detailed study” of the two costs so that a “better decision” on spending can be made.   RISK TO WATER SUPPLY Political and business leaders must also understand the scale of the “missing risks” in climate change, according to a recent joint report by the London School of Economics, the Columbia University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Economic assessments of the potential future risks … have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods because these risks are difficult to quantify precisely and lie outside of human experience,” the report states. One obvious scenario, however, is that a warmer climate means more droughts, so the reservoirs here and in Malaysia will be less than reliable. NEWater and desalinated water can close the gap, but they cost more. Their production requires between five and 17 times more energy, compared with the treatment of rainwater. These two water sources will also be affected by climate change, points out Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder.   “If we don’t have enough fresh water to begin with, we can’t recycle what we don’t have,” says the NTU professor. Seawater is not a simple solution either, as the warming of the oceans increases the amount of plankton such as algae. Most planktonic organisms, which drift in water, are microscopic. But in the right heat and light conditions, they can multiply and create blooms that are visible even from space. And scientists predict that climate change could make blooms more frequent. “We could have a decrease in the quality of the water,” says Snyder, who has focused on water issues for two decades and is a member of the World Health Organisation’s Drinking Water Advisory Panel.   “In Singapore, we rely primarily on membrane technology that separates the salt from the fresh water … So essentially, the increasing plankton in the ocean is more than the current filters were designed to handle, he adds. “They can still filter the water, but they can’t filter as much water. So it lowers production, and it makes the entire system less efficient.” Watch the episode here. Why It Matters is telecast every Monday at 9pm."""
Air pollution cuts lead quickly to large health benefits,20 Dec 2019 05:31AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/air-pollution-cuts-lead-quickly-to-large-health-benefits-12198804," (Reuters Health) - Reducing air pollution at its source can substantially improve health within a few weeks, and the savings from reduced death and disease exceed the costs, according to a review of existing research. The authors looked at evidence of reduced deaths and disability from heart and respiratory disease and other illnesses at the individual and population levels within days or weeks of measures to reduce small-particle air pollution. The most dramatic health improvements occurred in regions with high air pollution that reduced their total output, but even small areas that decreased air pollution slightly saw improvements, the study authors report in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society. Air pollution is a major risk factor for health in all organs of your body, and everyone needs to be aware that air pollution has real consequences,"" said Dr. Dean Schraufnagel of the University of Illinois at Chicago, the study's lead author. ""At the same time, air pollution is an avoidable health risk,"" he told Reuters Health by phone. ""Reducing it can result in prompt and substantial health gains and improve climate change as well."" Schraufnagel and colleagues at the Forum of International Respiratory Societies reviewed case studies where health improved after pollution was reduced, even if only for a short period of time, such as temporary restrictions around Olympic games. They focused on several questions, including how quickly health changes, how much it improves, whether international standards must be met to see health differences and whether national and international air quality standards are good enough to reduce disease related to air pollution. Overall, the team found that respiratory and irritation symptoms like coughing, sore throat, phlegm and shortness of breath improved within a few weeks after a reduction in pollution output from sources such as a steel mill, or pollution-reduction measures during the 1996 and 2008 Olympics. In addition, fewer children were absent from school or went to emergency rooms with severe asthma, and doctors saw fewer hospitalizations, clinic visits, premature births, heart attacks and deaths overall. In particular, bans on smoking in public areas reduced deaths overall, especially from heart and lung diseases. Ireland's national smoking ban in 2004, for instance, reduced heart attacks and childhood asthma attacks. ""The decrease in death and major diseases surprised me, but once you think about it, it makes sense because someone with heart disease could come in contact with smoke or fine particles in the air and have more stress on their body,"" Schraufnagel said. ""Policymakers and the public need to know how important this is."" Reducing household air pollution is important as well, he added. Switching to cleaner fuel, upgrading stoves and using household air filters significantly reduce health issues, the study authors found, including headaches, high blood pressure and asthma. Specifically, electric high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers decreased exposure to allergens and particles inside homes. On the largest scale, the authors cite the U.S. Clean Air Act as one of the most successful public health laws of all time, noting that it returned monetary benefits 32-fold greater than the costs of cutting pollution, according to a calculation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The savings came from reduced premature deaths, including 200,000 fewer heart attacks per year, and 66,000 fewer hospital admissions for respiratory disease per year. Although air pollution affects everyone, the study authors point out, the most vulnerable groups face higher risks, including children, the elderly, people with chronic diseases and the poor. Urban growth, industrialization and global warming contribute to these factors, which raises the degree of urgency for pollution control. ""To reduce air pollution and limit climate change, we need a rapid transition to a cleaner and renewable energy system coupled with increases in energy efficiency,"" said William Fisk of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Indoor Environment Group in Berkeley, California, who wasn't involved in the review. ""Get informed. With knowledge, individuals can reduce their air pollution exposures, particularly their indoor exposures, which often dominate,"" he told Reuters Health by email. ""The collective action of individuals is essential to reduce future air pollution and climate change.""

Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney,19 Dec 2019 07:19AM (Updated: 19 Dec 2019 04:45PM),AFP/Reuters/hs/hm,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-nsw-declares-emergency-wildfires-approach-sydney-12195594," SYDNEY: Australian authorities declared a seven-day state of emergency in New South Wales state Thursday (Dec 19) as a record heat wave fanned unprecedented bushfires raging across the region. As thousands of firefighters battled blazes, temperatures neared 50 degrees Celsius in some places and authorities warned the extreme weather conditions could get even worse. In New South Wales, Australia's most populated state with Sydney as its capital, more than 100 bushfires were burning on Thursday, many of them out of control. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the state of emergency, the second declared in the state since an early, drought-fueled bushfire season began in September, was due to catastrophic weather conditions"". Australia on Wednesday broke all-time heat records for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Narramore said the ""dangerous and disastrous"" heatwave was toppling dozens of ""extraordinary"" records across the country. ""We're heading into a fifth or sixth day in a row where multiple places broke a record. And we're likely to see 30 or 40 records around the country break,"" he told the ABC. Turbulent winds of up to 100km in the afternoon were expected to fan bushfires burning ever-closer to the city. Authorities said nearly 120 fires remained ablaze by late afternoon, more than half of which are uncontrolled, and with temperatures forecast to top 45 Celsius in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert.   In Shoalhaven, a popular coastal destination some 190km south of Sydney, local mayor Amanda Findley said people were poised to evacuate. ""There is a large amount of smoke looming over the city, which shows how close the fire is,"" Findley told Reuters by telephone. ""It is extremely hot and windy now so we are all worried the fire could spread. People are really worried that they may lose everything."" The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, which is home to more than 7 million people. ""STRIKE TEAMS"" ON STANDBY There are 2,000 firefighters battling the blazes with the support of US and Canadian teams, as well as Australia Defence Force personnel.   New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said five 100-person ""strike teams"" were on standby to deploy to the most dangerous fires. ""The worst of the fire weather conditions, the extreme fire danger ratings we are expecting today, are centred around the greater Sydney environment,"" he added. Fitzsimmons said some firefighters had been left ""shattered"" after losing their own homes while saving other properties. ""They and their families and colleagues are truly devastated by the loss,"" he said. ""It will be another very emotional, very draining day for our firefighters."" SMOKY SYDNEY The extreme weather is also causing major health concerns, with leading doctors this week labelling the smoke haze that has shrouded Sydney for weeks a ""public health emergency"". Hospitals have been recording large increases in emergency room visits for respiratory problems, including a dramatic 80 per cent spike when air quality plummeted on Dec 10. The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday. The major fires around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people, have resulted in days of heavy pollution in the city usually known for its sparkling harbour and blue skies. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city's southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people. By late afternoon, Sydney was sitting at No. 4 on the IQAir AirVisual live rankings of pollution in global cities, above Dhaka, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city. More than 70 fires are also raging across Queensland state to the north of NSW, including one at Peregian, near the coastal tourist hub of Noosa, that forced people to flee their homes Wednesday. Bushfires are also burning in South Australia and Western Australia.   At least three million hectares of land has been torched across Australia in recent months, with six people killed and more than 800 homes destroyed. POLITICAL STORM Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies. As local media reported Morrison was in Hawaii on a family holiday, about 500 protestors gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison's office refused to confirm his whereabouts. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, ""ScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?"" referencing the leader's nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive. Australia's low-lying Pacific neighbours have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation's climate policies following modest progress at the UN climate talks in Madrid. ""It was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze,"" Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday. Scientists say the blazes have come earlier and with more intensity than usual due to global warming and a prolonged drought that has left the land tinder dry and many towns running out of water."""
Commentary: Our holiday extravaganza has a huge carbon footprint,19 Dec 2019 06:09AM (Updated: 19 Dec 2019 06:10AM),CNA/el(sl),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/holiday-christmas-gift-give-present-carbon-footprint-environment-12193502," SINGAPORE: The climate crisis is on our minds, now that the Madrid United Nations conference came up short. With a host of holidays on our doorstep, how can we enjoy the holidays and still do our fair share to address global heating? Let’s start with one of the best parts of the holidays: Presents. With online shopping platforms like Lazada, AliExpress and Shopee, it has become even easier to experience the joy of giving. But will the recipient like our gift? “If they don’t like the gift, they (or we) can always send it back,” we might tell ourselves. However, one reverse logistics company Optoro estimates that 2.5 billion kg of returned gifts received by retailers end up in the rubbish. GIVE YOUR TIME Instead of buying new products, there are so many low-carbon gift-giving choices, if only we bothered to look. What about offering to enjoy an experience with gift recipients, such as a chance to play their favourite card or board game with us or to go with us to watch one of our many excellent local theatre companies? In this hectic world, a gift of our time may be the best most valued present of all. If we do want to buy something, here are some climate-friendly ideas. About 500 billion single-use plastic cups are used annually. That makes eco-friendly, reusable cups a gift that keeps on giving, and these cups come in an assortment of stylish colours and designs. Plus, places such as Starbucks offer discounts to customers who bring their own cups.   Thrift shops, such as those run by charities, including Salvation Army and MINDS, have pre-loved items looking for a new home, and the gift recipients will appreciate you thought so highly of them to believe they would appreciate a reused gift rather than worry their ego would be bruised unless they received something new. SAY NO TO WRAPPING PAPER After we’ve chosen or made a gift, we need to wrap it. In the UK alone, an estimated 50,000 carbon dioxide absorbing trees are chopped down for wrapping paper during the holiday season. The old standby for green wrapping paper is to use old newspaper. To spice up this type of gift wrapping, add fallen leaves or other nature items. Another alternative is to use a second present as the wrapping by putting presents inside towels, scarves, other clothing, and jars found at thrift shops. Yet another alternative is to use no wrapping at all. Instead, organise a scavenger hunt by hiding the unwrapped presents with the recipients’ names on them and letting everyone search for their own and others’ presents. DON’T FLY Many people like to travel for the holidays. Reduced air travel is another area in which combating the climate crisis can open our eyes to alternative ways to enjoy holiday time together. Rather than hopping on a plane and enduring long journeys in cramped cabins and long queues at customs to holiday in Iceland, South Africa or Korea, we can board a boat and in almost no time be enjoying nature, visiting a spa and tasting local delicacies in Batam and Bintan. Or, even easier and quicker, we can try a staycation. About two-thirds of Singaporeans have staycationed at least once and demand for staycations has risen 15 per cent recently.   Sometimes, the happiest and most surprising discoveries lie right in our backyards, not far away on the other side of the world. For example, how many of us have checked out the many Singapore heritage trails, such as the new one in Kallang, or tried the guided walks offered by NParks, VegThisCity and other providers? Hundreds of local Meetup groups and local media have pages listing the huge variety of cultural, recreational and educational events available in Singapore, some of which are free of charge. Here in Singapore we have easy access to a rainbow of cultures, from our local multiracial, multireligious society to the cosmopolitan array of peoples working and visiting here. We can expand our horizons without boarding a climate-warming airplane by stepping outside our comfort zones and meeting people different from ourselves here in Singapore. For example, many charities, such as the Singapore Children’s Society and ACRES, welcome volunteers. The connection goes so much deeper and can be so much more fulfilling when we volunteer at home, because the relationship is not hello-and-goodbye; it can be ongoing, with all the travelling done in only a matter of minutes on public transport. HIT PAUSE ON FASHION Fashion presents more opportunities to respond to the climate crisis, while reveling in being unique in our holiday best.   With the advent of fast fashion – inexpensive clothing produced quickly to respond to the latest fashion trends – we are now buying and discarding more clothing more quickly. A 2017 report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicted that by 2050, the world’s fashion industry could account for more than a fifth of our species’ carbon footprint. It is ironic that while it is fashionable to walk around with intentional holes and tears in our jeans, at the same time, we feel we must throw away other items of clothing at the first sign of wear-and-tear. Maybe we can start a new fashion trend using our Instagram and other social media. Let’s share pics of us wearing our shirts longer. For example, even when a shirt collar begins to fray, we can savour its familiar look and comfortable feel for another year or more. Plus, we can find colourful ways to do patches and other coverups, for example, by frequenting the local tailor and alteration shops found at wet markets. RETHINK EATING MEAT Last but not least, the centerpiece of many families’ holidays is the food. Here again, we can do our share to protect the earth for our younger generations to enjoy by tweaking the foods we enjoy so much. Animal agriculture – using animals for food – has produced more CO2 emissions than the entire global transportation sector over the last 100 years.   Fortunately, we can increase our consumption of plant-based foods and, in the process, discovery a wide variety of new foods and flavours, using spices – curry, chili, ginger, cumin, and more – with tofu, tempeh, lentils and other alternatives to meat, eggs and dairy. Many Singapore entrepreneurs are already engaged in recreating our favourite foods in climate-friendly ways. For instance, Singapore startup TurtleTree Labs is developing cow’s milk without the cows.

Commentary: How melting glaciers affect Indonesia – it's not just rising sea levels,18 Dec 2019 06:09AM (Updated: 18 Dec 2019 06:10AM),CNA/el,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/indonesia-glacier-melt-ipcc-un-ocean-sea-climate-change-marine-12182294," JAKARTA: Scientists, politicians and the people of Iceland recently placed a plaque mourning the loss of Okjokull glacier. Okjokull is no longer a living glacier because there has been insufficient ice build-up over the years to expand its glacial mass. The plaque acknowledges what is happening and what needs to be done in the next 200 years, because all of Iceland’s main glaciers are expected to suffer the same fate. INDONESIA’S GLACIERS Indonesia has glaciers on the Jayawijaya Mountains in Papua. The ice-covered peaks have lost 84.9 per cent of their glacial surface since 1988. A study has predicted the remaining glacial area will disappear within ten years. More alarming for Indonesia, climate change threatens not only its glaciers but also its vast seas, which make up around 70 per cent of the country’s area and are much deeper than the height of Jayawijaya Mountains. A panel of climate scientists under the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The report explains the latest understanding of our changing oceans and cryosphere (the cryosphere refers to the components of the Earth that are frozen). How are the SROCC’s findings relevant to Indonesia? CHANGING OCEANS Scientific findings have revealed the melting of the cryosphere that leads to global sea-level rise is just one of climate change’s many domino effects.   The report underlines that climate change causes the oceans to become warmer and more acidic and to lose oxygen persistently. Sea level rise that may submerge small islands happens not only continuously but is also accelerating. Extreme climate phenomena such as marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent, intense and long-lasting, particularly in the tropics. The same is true of extreme El Nino–Southern Oscillation events, which cause droughts and floods in Indonesia. THE STRAIN ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS SROCC contains several important warnings about climate change’s impact on Indonesia as a tropical, archipelagic country. First, marine biodiversity is at risk. Climate change causes shifts in seasonal rhythms and the geographical ranges of marine species. Since the 1950s, marine species living in the upper 200m of the sea have been shifting poleward at about 52 km per decade. A similar pattern is happening to seafloor ecosystems. Considering the high biodiversity of marine species in Indonesia, further research is needed on changes in seasonal rhythms and geographical distributions of marine species in Indonesia. Second, the report highlights coral reefs as the most sensitive key marine ecosystem compared to seagrass and mangrove ecosystems that are also prevalent in Indonesia.   As host to the largest seagrass ecosystems in Southeast Asia and 23 per cent of total mangrove forests in the world, this finding is important for Indonesia. Reduced seagrass and mangrove ecosystems may lower the capacity of coastal ecosystems to absorb carbon emissions. Third, ocean warming reduces Indonesia’s maximum sea catch potential by up to 30 per cent if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising throughout the 21st century. This adds to the burden on a fisheries sector already plagued by overfishing. Combined effects of warmer and more acidic waters also have negative consequences for fish stocks and calcareous marine organisms (such as pearl oysters and lobsters). DON’T BLAME EVERYTHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE To formulate effective adaptation strategies, we need to understand the interactions of environmental degradation that occurs not only because of climate change. A classic example is the problem of the rising sea level in Jakarta – it is primarily driven by land subsidence due to groundwater extraction. The UN report also makes a distinction between ocean and coastal acidification. Ocean acidification refers to the increase of hydrogen ions in ocean waters due to reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and seawaters. However, Indonesian seas also experience coastal acidification due to local activities such as waste and pollution that further acidify seawater.   Local solutions that could regulate the ambient seawater acidity may reduce the impact of ocean and coastal acidification on the local community. These include effective waste management and conservation of seagrass ecosystems. SROCC AND CLIMATE NEGOTIATION SROCC is an important scientific input for climate negotiation at the United Nationals Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Spain. As a maritime nation, Indonesia plays an important role in taking concrete and realistic actions on climate change. SROCC shows the benefits of employing ambitious and effective climate adaptation strategies, such as protecting coastal communities, particularly those with large populations, from rising sea level. This protection is in line with sustainable development. SROCC states that the ocean is largely a victim of climate change, while land is identified as the primary culprit as well as victim of climate change.   Warmer, more acidic and deoxygenated oceans have implications for Indonesia’s commitments to protect its biodiversity and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Climate change challenges our commitment to protect marine biodiversity, the capacity of coastal ecosystems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and the sustainable use of marine resources. Scientific findings from the SROCC and other UN publications should create momentum to take action that is inclusive and beyond business as usual. Such efforts will be appreciated by future generations. Intan Suci Nurhati is a scientist at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). This article first appeared on the Conversation. "
Goldman Sachs' green goal: US$750 billion in work for environmental projects by 2030,17 Dec 2019 08:21AM (Updated: 17 Dec 2019 10:10AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/goldman-sachs--green-goal--us-750-billion-in-work-for-environmental-projects-by-2030-12189236," NEW YORK: Goldman Sachs said on Monday it will provide US$750 billion in financing, advisory services and investments for green projects and companies, as well as those that foster economic opportunities for under-served people over the next decade. The bank sees a powerful business and investing case"" for working with companies that are taking steps to address climate change and inclusive growth, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon wrote in an editorial in the Financial Times announcing the goal. Goldman's moves, which also included ruling out any new loans for Arctic drilling or thermal coal mines, came just as the United Nations concludes a conference that failed to ramp up efforts to combat global warming. The US$750 billion figure is essentially the dollar amount that Goldman estimates it can generate in providing banking services and investment to companies and projects that are focused on renewable energy, sustainable transportation, affordable education and several other areas. On a call with reporters, Goldman executives said those banking services would include dealmaking, private equity-type investing and providing loans, but they declined to break down the top-line figure because it is dependent on market forces, they said. One example of work the bank believes it can replicate to meet this goal is a bond offering Goldman handled for Italian electricity company Enel earlier this year. Enel raised US$1.5 billion through a bond offering that linked the investments to its commitment to increase its renewable energy base by 25 per cent before 2022. The executives said the bank will not lose any significant amount of revenue as a result of the US$750 billion target or the internal ban on financing certain drilling and coal activities. The bank has not financed any projects that would fall afoul of that ban in recent memory, one executive said, in part because Goldman's due-diligence process takes into consideration and often rules out deals if they impact endangered species and indigenous populations."""
"Under fire over climate summit, Chile blames big polluters",,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/under-fire-over-climate-summit--chile-blames-big-polluters-12189098," SANTIAGO: Chile defended itself on Monday (Dec 16) against criticism it was too weak in presiding over international climate change negotiations, saying it did all it could but that four big polluting countries got in the way. Chilean President Sebastien Pinera described as insufficient"" the agreements reached on Sunday after marathon talks, but said it was not for the host’s lack of trying and criticism of its role was unfair. ""You have to convince 195 countries, and so if just one opposes, there is no agreement,"" Pinera said in comments to local media. When it came to rules governing carbon markets, he said: ""The four big countries didn't accept the proposals."" Pinera said he personally lobbied other presidents to reach a deal, but would not identify who he called and did not name the countries which he said blocked the deal. ""The countries that pollute the most did not live up to the challenge and remain in debt,"" he said in a subsequent tweet. Diplomats have listed the Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United States among those resisting bolder action. Chile had stepped in to preside over the talks after Brazil pulled out following the election victory of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. It was then forced to host them more than 10,000 kilometres away in Spain due to unrest at home. Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, president of the UN summit known as COP25, came under fire on Saturday for circulating a draft text that campaigners said threatened to undermine the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on carbon reduction. ""If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,"" David Waskow of the World Resources Institute, said in the cavernous venue at the time. Greenpeace International said the Chileans were being ""irresponsibly weak"". Pinera said it was not fair to blame her. ""She did all that was humanly possible,"" he said. By extending the talks, Schmidt salvaged a face-saving compromise text during late-night discussions. It cited the ""urgent need"" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement to avert catastrophic global warming. FUTURE CHALLENGES Schmidt said she was ""sad and pained"" at how nations had failed to find consensus but that the issue of carbon markets - a key sticking point - had tied down the last four summits. ""Neither the will nor the political maturity yet exists from some of the big emitting countries to be able to reach agreement on this,"" she told a news conference. Laurence Tubiana, Chief Executive Officer of European Climate Foundation, said to win commitments more in line with the warnings of climate science the next host would need to build broad alliances and force those blocking progress to explain themselves openly. ""It means deploying an intensive diplomatic effort right now,"" she said. Britain will preside over the next summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November 2020. Challenges include Brazil's insistence on a carbon accounting approach others say is baffling and Australia's insistence on carrying over old credits to meet its Paris emissions targets, which others see as an accounting trick. Brazil and developing countries, in turn, accused the European Union and other industrialized economies of stymieing progress on financial aid for poorer countries, saying they could not be more ambitious on their climate goals unless they received more assistance. Chile did manage to coax some governments into joining a new Ambition Alliance of mostly small countries, cities and businesses committed to slashing emissions. But the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations felt marginalized as Chile tried to force deadlocked major players into a compromise. Belize's Carlos Fuller, who represented small island states, told Reuters he was forced to assert himself by striding into a side-gathering of delegates from the United States, Brazil and European Union so they would be sure to see him. ""We should have been invited into that room,"" he said."""
Commentary: The spectacular failure of the Madrid climate talks,17 Dec 2019 06:18AM (Updated: 17 Dec 2019 08:29AM),CNA/el (ml),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/cop25-un-madrid-climate-talks-fail-paris-agreement-carbon-market-12187652," MELBOURNE: The United Nations’ COP25 climate talks concluded on Sunday (Dec 15) morning in Madrid, almost 40 hours overtime. After two weeks of protracted talks meant to address the planetary warming emergency, world leaders spectacularly failed to reach any real outcomes. The degree to which wealthy nations, including Australia, blocked progress on critical points of debate incensed both observers and country delegates. These points included robust rules for the global trading of carbon credits, increased commitments for finance to help developing nations tackle climate change, and most importantly, raising ambition to a level consistent with averting catastrophic climate impacts. HIGH HOPES COP25 was a conference of “parties”, or nations, signed up to the Paris Agreement, which takes effect in 2021. I attended the conference as an observer. Emissions reduction targets of nations signed up to Paris put Earth on track for a 3.2 degrees Celsius temperature increase this century. However the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says warming must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating climate impacts. Much was riding on the outcome in Madrid. However, it failed to deliver. One of the key agenda items was Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, involving international carbon trading between nations.   The previous COP in Poland failed to reach consensus on these trading rules, and after this latest meeting, many contentious issues remained unresolved. These include: THE QUESTION OF KYOTO CREDITS Australia was pushing to allow use of Kyoto Protocol units, for which it drew scathing criticism from other nations, international media and observers. It plans to meet more than half its Paris target via this accounting loophole. Brazil, India, South Korea and China also want to carry over credits earned under the Clean Development Mechanism, a trading scheme under Kyoto. No consensus was reached. The negotiations for rules for carbon markets will now continue at COP26 in Glasgow next year, just weeks out from the Paris Agreement’s start date. The argument will not be easily resolved. Five of the last seven COP meetings failed to reach a decision on carbon market rules, indicating the extent of international divisions, and calling into question the disproportionate focus on carbon trading, given its limited ability to address climate change.   In Madrid, 31 nations signed up to the San Jose principles, seeking to ensure environmental integrity in carbon markets. Upholding these principles would mean emissions must go down, not up as a result of trading carbon. OTHER FAILURES The conference also discussed measures to strengthen the governance and finance arrangements of the Warsaw International Mechanism, a measure designed to compensate poor nations for climate damage. Little progress was made on mobilising finance from developed nations. The US, which will soon exit the Paris Agreement, played a key role in stymieing progress. It resisted efforts for broad governance arrangements, and pushed for language in the rulebook which would exclude high-emitting nations from liability for the loss and damage experienced by vulnerable countries under climate change. At Glasgow, all nations under Paris are required to submit new emissions reduction commitments. It was widely expected that the Madrid meeting would strongly urge nations to ensure these targets were more ambitious than the last. Instead, the final text only “reminds” parties to “communicate” their commitments in 2020. CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY"" When the COP finally closed on Sunday morning, the meeting had failed to reach consensus on increasing emissions reduction ambition to the level required. The results are disheartening. The world has let another chance slip by to tackle the climate crisis, and time is fast running out.   The implications of this were perhaps summed up best by the low-lying Pacific island state of Tuvalu, whose representative Ian Fry said of the outcome: ""There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity."" Kate Dooley is a research fellow at the Climate and Energy College, University of Melbourne.

Commentary: We call it climate change. It's more like a global health crisis,16 Dec 2019 06:15AM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:20AM),Project Syndicate/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-global-warming-pollution-health-crisis-12184638," GENEVA: The climate crisis is also a health crisis. The same emissions that cause global warming are also largely responsible for polluting the air we breathe, causing heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and infections, and affecting every organ in our bodies. Air pollution is the new tobacco, causing as many deaths as cigarettes do. And though it threatens us all, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and adults with weakened immune systems are the most at risk. OUR POOR ATTITUDES ABOUT AIR POLLUTION It is now common knowledge that smoking tobacco severely harms you and those around you. That is why the tobacco industry’s lobbying and advertising campaigns have been strictly regulated around the world. Globally, we have taken steps to safeguard existing health policies, and to force these companies to tell the truth: That their product kills. And yet, our reaction is very different when we learn that air pollution and fossil-fuel-driven climate change are just as deadly. Where are the policies to prevent the fossil-fuel industry from lobbying governments, or to end the US$370 billion in subsidies lavished on coal, oil, and gas companies every year? Why are we still paying for a product that is killing us? As with the world’s strong response to tobacco, ending harmful fossil-fuel use will require scaling up current policy interventions and social-mobilisation efforts. Fortunately, some multilateral financial organisations have already recognised the opportunity that such a change represents.   Just recently, the European Investment Bank announced that it would end all of its funding for unabated fossil-fuel projects, and use its position to funnel public and private capital toward renewable energy. LIFE OR DEATH The choice between phasing out fossil fuels and continuing on the current path is black and white – it is a matter of life or death. We either will decide to prevent 7 million premature deaths per year by cleaning up our air and providing people with clean energy sources, or we won’t. We either will decide to prevent 4 million childhood asthma cases per year from traffic fumes, or we won’t. In any case, the lifetime health of a child born today will be profoundly affected by the decisions we make about climate change now and in the years to come. That is why the World Health Organisation has made climate change a top institutional priority.   KEEPING CLIMATE ACTION HIGH ON THE AGENDA Climate change should be a priority for all businesses, governments, and multilateral organisations, too. Keeping the issue high on the agenda provides the necessary motivation to make difficult choices. By taking action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degree Celsius relative to the pre-industrial level, we would not only ensure that our planet remains hospitable for future generations; we could also save at least one million lives per year, according to WHO’s estimates. Moreover, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, eliminating air pollution would save the economy 4 per cent of GDP per year in averted healthcare costs. In China and India, reducing emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius would more than pay for itself when accounting for the attendant health benefits. Likewise, transforming our food and transportation systems would save still more lives, by providing healthier diets and encouraging more physical activity – all while cleaning the air and stabilising the climate.   The human right to a healthy life and a sustainable future is increasingly being enforced through legal systems, and officials that fail to uphold these rights are being held accountable. In France, for example, a court found that the government had failed to do enough to limit air pollution around Paris, and in Indonesia, Jakarta residents similarly took legal action against the government because of air pollution. PUSHING FOR ACTION At this year’s United Nations General Assembly, many governments answered the WHO’s call to achieve “air quality that is safe for citizens, and to align climate change and air pollution policies by 2030.” This represents an encouraging first step. Now, many of the countries with the heaviest health burden from air pollution need to phase out their highest-pollution energy sources. At WHO, we will continue to push for action on these issues, while collaborating with others who are doing the same. Like the pollution that causes it, climate change does not observe national borders; it does not save its effects just for those who pollute. On the contrary, inequality is a key feature of the climate crisis: Those least responsible for the problem – children, disadvantaged communities, and the Global South – must bear a disproportionate share of the health burden.   WHO’s new global survey shows that many countries are highly exposed, vulnerable, and unsupported in dealing with health risks from climate change and air pollution. It is clear that we need an international and just response to this increasing strain on public health. Future efforts must reflect the real costs of our fossil-fuel based economy and aid those most affected. To achieve this, we will need all signatories to the Paris climate accord to strengthen their national climate plans by 2020. Beyond that, we need to establish new, robust mechanisms for protecting the most vulnerable and helping communities adapt to the realities of climate change. Health must be at the heart of our Paris commitments. The pollution that is choking our air and warming our planet has been accumulating for generations. We cannot afford to take that long to fix the problem. Maria Neira is Director of the Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organisation."
UN chief calls climate summit a 'lost opportunity',15 Dec 2019 10:46PM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:56AM),AFP/aa/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/un-chief-calls-climate-summit-a-lost-opportunity-12185884," MADRID: A major climate summit wrapped up in Madrid on Sunday (Dec 15) with a compromise deal that left little to show, prompting UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to lament a lost opportunity"" to act. Almost a fortnight of COP 25 talks just squeezed out hard-earned compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. ""I am disappointed with the results of COP 25,"" Guterres said. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" The summit's final declaration ""expresses the urgent need"" for new carbon cutting commitments to close the gap between current emissions and the Paris treaty goal of capping temperature at below two degrees Celsius, said host country Spain. ""Today, the citizens of the world are asking for us to move ahead faster and better,"" Carolina Schmidt, Chilean environment minister and President of COP 25, told the closing plenary. But Tina Eonemto Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, denounced the response as inadequate for facing an existential threat of rising sea levels. ""Unfortunately, the new text we adopted this morning does not reflect anything near what we would have wanted. It is the bare minimum and we regret that countries could not agree on a more ambitious text,"" Stege said. MAJOR PLAYERS 'DID NOT DELIVER' Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down. The summit - moved at the last minute from Chile due to unrest - at times teetered on the brink of collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests. Negotiators from nearly 200 nations came to Spain's capital with the aim of finalising the rulebook for the 2015 Paris accord, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature to below two degrees Celsius. ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and, as France's top negotiator, a main architect of the Paris Agreement. ""But thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro however blamed the rich nations. ""I'd like to know: has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?"" he said Sunday, speaking from his country. Bolsonaro has been widely criticised for easing restrictions on exploiting the Amazon's vast riches, leading to an acceleration in deforestation there. ""MISSING IN ACTION"" With the accord set to become operational next year, campaigners had hoped that protests, irrefutable science, and deadly storms and wildfires that marked 2019, would move governments to redouble their efforts at COP 25. But that greater ambition largely failed to materialise, leaving some veteran observers aghast. ""Most of the world's biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a 28-year veteran of the climate process. The push for strengthening voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union. These have called out nations they see as blocking consensus - notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India, the world's No. 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030. These emerging giants chose instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. 'LOSS AND DAMAGE' The summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook. Instead, the focus now switches to next year's COP 26 in Glasgow, when the true Paris deadline falls. The US, which is leaving the Paris deal next year, was accused of playing spoiler on a number of issues. This included so-called ""loss and damage"" funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild. ""The US has not come here in good faith,"" said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid. ""They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change."" Even if all countries implement their current plans under Paris, Earth is on course to warm more than 3C by 2100. Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg - named 2019 Person of the Year by Time magazine - on Friday slammed world leaders for ""still trying to run away from their responsibilities"" while demanding a ""year of action"" in 2020."""
UN climate conference offered countries better understanding despite lack of overall consensus: Masagos,15 Dec 2019 10:14PM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:44AM),CNA/AFP/ga,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/masagos-zulkifli-climate-change-cop-25-united-nations-summit-12185804," MADRID: The recently concluded United Nations climate summit in Madrid did not result in an overall consensus, but “we must not lose hope”, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said on Sunday (Dec 15). Despite the inconclusive summit, the discussions “offered countries a better understanding of one another’s positions”, he said in a Facebook post. “This places us in good stead as we work on moving forward.” The 12-day COP 25 summit sought to resolve issues in implementing the Paris Climate Accord. It ended with a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. Mr Masagos co-facilitated the overarching decision texts for the conference, which were “successfully adopted”. “With this, we will keep the drive to address Climate Change alive and take up new areas of concern like the Ocean and its climate impact,” he said. The summit is “a reminder of the importance of support for multilateralism as a key framework, for diverse countries to jointly advocate common causes such as climate change, free trade and peace”, Mr Masagos added. He also expressed regret that one of the key deliverables, carbon markets, did not come through. “(Carbon markets) would enable countries and industries with deficit carbon credits to buy from countries that have an excess of them,” he said. “Countries with excess credits are usually those with green lungs and such a system would incentivise them to maintain them.” He added that this would also help fund vulnerable and developing countries to cope with the future impact of climate change. Last week, the minister reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming. Singapore had pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise its emissions with the aim of peaking around that year. “Let us not be defined by our differences, but our common objective of safeguarding our planet for future generations,” he said. “We will work with the incoming UK COP-26 Presidency to achieve a good outcome in Glasgow.”"
"Facing climate emergency, UN summit staggers on",15 Dec 2019 05:53AM (Updated: 15 Dec 2019 06:00AM),AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/facing-climate-emergency-un-summit-staggers-on-12185094,"  MADRID: A UN climate summit in Madrid was on life support Saturday (Dec 14) after marathon negotiations between countries left them more divided than ever over on how to fight global warming and pay for its ravages. Diplomats from rich nations, emerging giants and the world's poorest countries - each for their own reasons - found fault with a draft agreement put forward by host Chile in a botched attempt to strike common ground. Faced with fire-alarm warnings from science, deadly extreme weather made worse by climate change, and weekly strikes by millions of young people, negotiations in Madrid were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down in tackling the crisis. But the 12-day talks, more than 24 hours after their scheduled end, had retreated even further from this goal on Saturday. Simon Stiell, Grenada envoy, told AFP that the lack of ambition in the initial agreement text was crazy"". ""It isn't reflective of the kids who are demonstrating on the streets the world over, communities being washed away by rising sea levels,"" he said late Saturday. ""We wanted provisions that were in the Paris agreement to remain and what we see at every COP it just seems to be another opportunity to erode those."" UNPRECEDENTED DISCONNECT Veteran observers of UN climate talks were stunned by the state of play nearly 24 hours after the negotiations had been due to close. ""I have never seen such a disconnect between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, versus what the climate negotiations are delivering,"" Alden Meyer, strategy and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told AFP. Alexandria Villasenor, a 14-year-old climate activist, said she was ""disappointed"" in the lack of action at COP 25. ""The difference between the youth on the streets and the negotiations is that the youth on the streets are acting with urgency,"" she told AFP. ""COP 25 has failed us and it's another year of failure.""   Under the Paris accord, countries agreed in 2015 to work to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius through a series of voluntary action pledges that step up over time. The push for a strengthening of voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union. Ministers from this ""high ambition coalition"" have called out countries they see as blocking a consensus call for all countries to step up, notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India, the world's No 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, have made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030. These emerging giants have chosen instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. Observers told AFP Saturday evening that a possible landing ground had emerged in which China agreed to yield a little over language surrounding ambition in return for a clear reiteration of historic polluters' obligation to do more. The COP 25 summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook, which goes into effect next year. Some nations, notably Brazil and Australia, want to count carbon credits accumulated under a previous climate deal as part of their commitments under the Paris goals, further stymying progress. 'PEOPLE MUST RISE UP' The United States, which is leaving the landmark Paris climate deal next year, was accused of acting as a spoiler on a number of issues vital to climate-vulnerable nations. This included so-called ""loss and damage"" funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild. ""The US has not come here in good faith,"" said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid. ""They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change."" Even if nations in Madrid snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and agree to implement their pledges, Earth is on course to warm more than 3 degree Celsius by 2100. ""If there was one time in the history when I would say governments f***ed up, I would say today in Madrid, governments f***ed up,"" said Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa.

"Frustrated with climate talks, activists dump manure outside Madrid summit",15 Dec 2019 05:31AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/frustrated-with-climate-talks--activists-dump-manure-outside-madrid-summit-12184908," MADRID: Green activists dumped horse manure and staged a mock hanging outside the venue of a UN climate summit in Madrid on Saturday (Dec 14), airing their frustration at the failure of world leaders to take meaningful action against global warming. Led by grassroots group Extinction Rebellion, the actions were timed to coincide with the closing of the COP25 summit, where negotiators have been unable to agree on how to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Just like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic, this COP’s fiddling of carbon accounting and negotiating of Article 6 is not commensurate to the planetary emergency we face,"" Extinction Rebellion said in a statement. Twelve members of the group stood on melting blocks of ice, nooses drawn tight around their necks to symbolise the 12 months remaining until the next summit, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase. Attached to the pile of manure was a short message to leaders saying ""the horseshit stops here."" In contrast to a protest held last weekend, in which hundreds of demonstrators blocked one of Madrid's central shopping streets for a mass disco-dance, the mood at the gathering was subdued. ""Even if they reach an agreement it's still not enough. This is the 25th COP they've had and nothing has really changed,"" protester Emma Deane told Reuters from her perch atop an ice block, holding her young daughter in her arms. ""She's going to grow up in a world where there's no food on the shelves and that breaks my heart."" Still, Extinction Rebellion spokesman Ronan McNern stressed the importance of humour in the face of the climate crisis. ""Out of shit comes the best roses.

Fate of global climate action 'in the balance' as UN talks go down to wire,14 Dec 2019 09:28AM (Updated: 14 Dec 2019 09:34AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/fate-of-global-climate-action--in-the-balance--as-un-talks-go-down-to-wire-12183180," MADRID: Big polluting countries faced last-ditch pressure from smaller nations to show serious commitment to fighting climate change as negotiators battled into the early hours of Saturday (Dec 14) to salvage a result from a fraught UN summit in Madrid. With the two-week gathering mired in interlocking disputes over how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming, Chile, presiding over the talks, had earlier attempted to inject a note of optimism. Today is the day when we must show the world that we are capable of delivering the agreements that are needed to tackle the unprecedented challenge before us,"" Andrés Landerretche, a Chilean official, told a news conference late on Friday. Chile later announced the talks, which had been due to end on Friday, would resume at 0700am (0600 GMT) on Saturday. Observers said delegates were struggling to resolve the question of whether big emitters will signal their intent to raise their emissions-cutting targets next year, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase. ""The fate of the Paris Agreement is in the balance,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based think tank. Fast-growing emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are reluctant to commit themselves to unveiling new goals so soon, observers say, fearing they will end up paying the price of emissions cuts that should be borne by the rich. The European Union, whose members, barring Poland, agreed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, is pushing for a more ambitious statement of intent, along with many of the most vulnerable developing countries. After two weeks of talks in Madrid, held after months of preparation, ministers were holed up in small groups attempting to break deadlocks over financial aid for states at most risk from climate change, and rules governing carbon markets. Progress on those issues would help deliver the bigger prize: A clear statement from the gathering that governments are committed to honouring the Paris deal by imminently announcing more ambitious action to wean themselves off fossil fuels. ""There is a very big question on the commitment of the parties to the Paris Agreement,"" said Mohamed Nasr, chair of the Africa bloc of negotiators. ""25 YEARS OF TALKS"" With scientists warning that the window to prevent the Earth's climate hitting irreversible tipping points is fast closing, an increasingly strident activism movement says a strong signal from the summit is the only acceptable outcome. ""We've had 25 years of talks and the only thing that really matters is global emissions are still rising,"" said Tim Crosland, a prominent member of Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign, after meeting officials at the talks. Campaigners are concerned that as negotiations dragged on into the early hours of Saturday, delegates may be tempted to hastily adopt weak resolutions to conclude the marathon. The talks have been overshadowed since the outset by a formal move by US President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing from the Paris accord last month. Observers said the US delegation repeated a pattern seen at past talks of blocking progress toward ensuring poor countries can secure compensation for climate-related losses. But the weight of negotiating effort focused on trying to persuade Australia, Brazil and others to drop their insistence on carrying over credits from old carbon trading schemes. The EU and small island states say that continuing to count such credits would dramatically weaken the fight to curb emissions. Brazil has also come under fire for opposing attempts to impose gold standard accounting rules on the carbon trade. ""We don't want any accounting tricks being created here,"" said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch, an advocacy group. ""It would be a massive disaster ... if we end up with flawed and weak rules."""""
Australia's climate stance sparks anger at UN summit,13 Dec 2019 11:45PM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-climate-stance-anger-un-summit-12183202," MADRID: Campaigners slammed Australia on the final day of a UN climate summit on Friday (Dec 13) as its policy of using old carbon credits to count towards future emissions targets emerged as a major sticking point in negotiations. The talks aim to agree outstanding details of how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid catastrophic global warming ahead of a crucial implementation phase next year, with carbon trading among the main outstanding issues. Australia wants to use carbon credits assigned to developed economies under the Kyoto Protocol, a precursor climate accord, to meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Paris accord. Britain, Germany, New Zealand and others have ruled out such an approach, saying it undermines the spirit of the Paris deal. Using the credits would allow Australia to appear to meet its commitments while taking essentially no new action to reduce emissions, said Richie Merzian, climate director at The Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think-tank. There's bushfires that are ravaging Australia right now that are clearly linked to climate change and that are choking Australia's largest cities with all the smoke,"" Merzian told Reuters at the two-week negotiations in Madrid. ""Instead of coming to Madrid to argue for more global action to address climate change, Australia is lobbying to do less,"" said Merzian, a former Australian government climate negotiator. As UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the world would be ""doomed"" unless big emitters step up commitments, Australia's energy minister Angus Taylor said targets alone cannot address climate change, no matter how ambitious. ""We can only reduce emissions as fast as the deployment of commercially viable technology allows,"" Taylor told delegates. Costa Rica, Fiji and others have criticised Australia's stance. Fiji's economy minister Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said he hoped to see some ""rationality"" from Australia: ""At the moment, we have seen they are far from sitting at the same table."" Australia's reliance on coal-fired power makes it one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita and in June it approved a huge new coal mine by India's Adani Enterprises. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government insists that Australia will meet a pledge to cut emissions by at least 26 per cent ""at a canter"" by 2030 versus 2005 levels. But independent analysts say that with emissions trending upwards, it looks unlikely that Australia will be able to achieve the target. On Tuesday, The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index rated Australia as one of the worst performers among 57 high-emitters, with it earning 0 out of 100 possible points for its policies."""
"'Moral call to rest of the world' on climate from hardest hit countries, Obama says",13 Dec 2019 05:24PM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/barack-obama-climate-change-moral-call-kuala-lumpur-12182442," KUALA LUMPUR: Island nations and poor coastal countries facing the severest effects of climate change offer a moral call to the rest of the world"" to act now, former US President Barack Obama said on Friday (Dec 13). ""For those of you who are ... experiencing the effects of it right now, there may be some hard questions in terms of adaptation versus mitigation,"" Obama said at a youth leaders conference in Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur, organised by the Obama Foundation. Island countries that could disappear due to rising sea levels had on Thursday accused rich nations of losing sight of the urgency of the crisis, as a UN summit enters the final stretch of negotiations for countries to honour the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. ""Your voice, your witness to what's happening right here and now, is a moral call to the rest of the world. And figuring out how to tell the story of what you are seeing, and the losses that are already taking place, that's going to be important."" The United States signed onto the 2015 Paris Agreement during Obama's presidency, promising a 26 to 28 per cent cut in emissions by 2025 from 2005 levels. But the administration of Obama's successor Donald Trump filed paperwork last week to withdraw from the pact. The Paris accord aims to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios foreseen by climate scientists by limiting the rise in average global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels. Once it exits, the United States - the top historic greenhouse gas emitter and leading oil and gas producer - will become the only country outside the accord. Obama said that it is up to the world's youth to lead the charge in dealing with climate change, blaming the previous generation for failing to handle the issue ""the way it should have"". ""The oceans will be rising, and that is going to displace people. So we'll to have to anticipate and care for some of the consequences, including large scale migrations and disruptions. That's going to be very possible,"" Obama said. ""Old people are not going to worry about this as much as young people because they're going to be gone when the full effects of this will come.

"Commentary: Kelantan’s epic struggles with great, yellow floods each monsoon",13 Dec 2019 06:23AM (Updated: 13 Dec 2019 06:30AM),CNA/el(sl),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/malaysia-flood-kelantan-terengganu-develop-poor-land-forest-mine-12179072," SINGAPORE: Malaysia saw some of its worst floods in 2014 with Kelantan suffering the brunt of the damage. Some 202,000 people in the state were displaced and 13 died. Over three days, 1,295mm of rainfall was recorded in Gua Musang - the equivalent of 64 days of rain usually seen in the area. During the floods, Kelantan’s rivers had risen between 10 to 38m – a serious problem when the official danger point for these rivers’ rise is 9m. The inclement weather also severely affected the neighbouring states of Pahang and Terengganu. During the same season, many other areas in Malaysia – including Negeri Sembilan, Johor and Sabah - also suffered floods. Then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was on holiday in the US and elected not to declare a state of emergency upon his return. But that didn’t stop Malaysian civil society groups from getting swiftly into action to mobilise help for those stranded without food or clean water. Countless convoys of vans and trucks moved north, packed to the brim with supplies and equipment – a huge uncoordinated NGO and civilian effort that eventually complemented national disaster response teams. There were also generous foreign contributions of cash, manpower, equipment and emergency rations from Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, China and other concerned neighbours. PERENNIAL PROBLEM While the 2014 floods were the worst in Kelantan’s history, such floods have returned each year during the monsoon season. Significant floods were recorded in 1927 and 1967 in Kelantan. Every year since 2014, heavy rainfall coupled with high tides threaten the return of Bah Kuning (yellow flood) – named so by locals because of the food waters’ high mud content.   While the blame for recurring floods and severe storms usually falls on climate change, the reason for Kelantan’s woes are manifold. While climate change and global warming have led to more frequent extreme weather phenomena and intensive rainfall over short periods of time, which have the worst impact when tides are high, these issues only serve to enhance the problems peculiar to Kelantan. Kelantan is one of the least developed and poorest states in Malaysia. There are no gleaming cities of skyscrapers or urban amenities in the state. Instead, the state is isolated from the rest of the peninsula by the Titiwangsa Mountains; a range that encircles the Kelantan River basin – a fertile rice-bowl that has also historically supported rubber and tobacco plantations. HUGE LAND ASSETS Launched in 2006, the Kelantan People’s Farm programme set aside 600,000 ha of forest reserve for monocrop plantations. It has been argued that a poor state led by an opposition government has little choice but to raise money through the assets that it has. Kelantan's oil fields provide revenue to Petronas and the federal government. It has recently filed a lawsuit to claim unpaid oil royalties of about RM1 billion (US$240 million) that could improve infrastructure and alleviate poverty in the state. Kelantan is also blessed with land and forests. But today, much of the state’s forests, hills and mountains have been razed for oil palm, durian plantations and mining, depriving the state of natural flood prevention features.   Once land, plantation or mining licences are carved out and distributed, forests are logged – this is the first source of income for opportunistic businessmen. Primary forest timber is a goldmine. Thereafter, the land is stripped and sowed for planting, or dug into for its gold, manganese or iron ore – all of which either result in or require the use of toxic materials to extract desired minerals. ONE, TWO, THREE, MONSOON When the monsoon arrives, several things happen. One, hills bare from logging or mining are no longer able to absorb rainfall and everything slides off mud and clay slopes into the river basin. This is why Kelantan’s floodwaters are yellow. Two, felled logs stacked by the river banks to be barged to transportation points are sucked into floodwaters and subsequently block river mouths and exit points – forcing water levels to rise. Three, add to that a high tide, and waters rushing down from the hills are met with seawater heading upriver. All of Kelantan’s towns are located in its river basin, adjacent to the rivers that can both support and destroy its communities. Given that this has now become an annual occurrence, and since it is clear that logging has disastrous consequences on the state’s townships, why isn’t more done to tackle the scourge of flooding? THE POLITICS OF IT The Malaysian Meteorological Department is a highly professional entity that accurately predicts extraordinary rainfall and potential flooding well in advance – sending out evacuation warnings to both citizens and other agencies to prepare for adverse conditions. However, some citizens refuse to pay heed to these warnings and are highly reluctant to evacuate. At times bipartisan tensions prevent immediate and effective disaster response and mitigation.   During the 2014 floods, volunteers on the ground reported that some villagers refused assistance from certain political or religious groups. Some volunteers who travelled north to help also refused to distribute emergency rations and equipment to areas that were not of political interest to them. All of these artificially and politically-created divisions get in the way of effective disaster management and response. Kelantan has always been an opposition state, ruled by the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Distrust and other tensions between the state and the federal government hampers effective collaboration for both disaster relief and habitat conservation. WHOSE LINE IS IT? On top of that is the problem of lax local attitudes to waste management. Even during the dry season, when there are no rains to sweep rubbish from land into the rivers and seas, Kelantanese rivers nearest to the townships are already black from pollution and chock full of waste. There is little proper waste or sanitation systems in some parts of the state. Many citizens also choose to use the drains, streams and rivers as their rubbish bins. All of this waste clogs drainage systems. When a storm is factored in, waste and logs seal these systems shut – and water levels rise. In the Malaysian constitution, the federal government is responsible for issues of the environment; including matters of stewardship, conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.   However, jurisdiction over land, water, mining and forests remain with the state. This means that the federal government can only advise the state, but cannot force it to stop logging, mining or clearing hills. Because licences to mine, plant and log are lucrative sources of income, Kelantan does not seem to be inclined to put a stop to it. The only way that this situation can be improved or mitigated is for regulations in this area to change. Revisions to the Water Resources Act and the Environmental Quality Act have been discussed, but it is unclear whether revisions can be implemented as state governments will be reluctant to release control over vital sources of income. But Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin’s calls for the Malaysian government to be accorded with greater enforcement powers has gained traction since Johor water supplies were disrupted in March after a major pollution incident at Sungai Kim Kim. Jurisdictional overlaps remain at the heart of the problem. Until this is resolved, Kelantan citizens can only brace themselves for increasingly frequent floods, do what they can to protect their property and belongings, and pay heed to the orders to evacuate.

First commercial electric plane takes flight in Canada,12 Dec 2019 02:41AM (Updated: 12 Dec 2019 02:50AM),AFP/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/first-commercial-electric-plane-takes-flight-in-canada-12177552," VANCOUVER: The world's first fully electric commercial aircraft took its inaugural test flight on Tuesday (Dec 10), taking off from the Canadian city of Vancouver and offering hope that airlines may one day end their polluting emissions. This proves that commercial aviation in all-electric form can work,"" said Roei Ganzarski, chief executive of Seattle-based engineering firm magniX. The company designed the plane's motor and worked in partnership with Harbour Air, which ferries half a million passengers a year between Vancouver, Whistler ski resort and nearby islands and coastal communities. Ganzarski said the technology would mean significant cost savings for airlines - not to mention zero emissions. ""This signifies the start of the electric aviation age,"" he told reporters. Civil aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions as people increasingly take to the skies and new technologies have been slow to get off the ground. At 285 grammes of CO2 emitted per kilometre travelled by each passenger, airline industry emissions far exceed those from all other modes of transport, according to the European Environment Agency. The emissions contribute to global warming and climate change, which scientists say will unleash ever harsher droughts, superstorms, and sea-level rise. The e-plane - a 62-year-old, six-passenger DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver seaplane retrofitted with an electric motor - was piloted by Greg McDougall, founder and chief executive of Harbour Air. ""For me that flight was just like flying a Beaver, but it was a Beaver on electric steroids. I actually had to back off on the power,"" he said. McDougall took the plane on a short loop along the Fraser River near Vancouver International Airport in front of around 100 onlookers soon after sunrise. ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY FLYING The flight lasted less than 15 minutes, according to an AFP journalist on the scene. ""Our goal is to actually electrify the entire fleet. There's no reason not to,"" said McDougall. On top of fuel efficiency, the company would save millions in maintenance costs, as electric motors require ""drastically"" less upkeep, McDougall said. However, Harbour Air will have to wait at least two years before it can begin electrifying its fleet of more than 40 seaplanes. The e-plane has to be tested further to confirm it is reliable and safe. In addition, the electric motor must be approved and certified by regulators. In Ottawa, Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters ahead of the maiden flight that he had his ""fingers crossed that the electric plane will work well."" If it does, he said, ""it could set a trend for more environmentally friendly flying."" Battery power is also a challenge. An aircraft like the one flown on Tuesday could only fly about 160 kilometres on lithium battery power, said Ganzarski. While that's not far, it's sufficient for the majority of short-haul flights run by Harbour Air. ""The range now is not where we'd love it to be, but it's enough to start the revolution,"" said Ganzarski, who predicts batteries and electric motors will eventually be developed to power longer flights. While the world waits, he said cheaper short-haul flights powered by electricity could transform the way people connect and where they work. ""If people are willing to drive an hour to work, why not fly 15 minutes to work?"" he said."""
UN head demands bolder climate action or 'we are doomed',11 Dec 2019 09:57PM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/un-antonio-guterres-demands-bolder-climate-action-12176720," MADRID: UN chief Antonio Guterres exhorted major world economies on Wednesday (Dec 11) to signal more ambitious commitments to cut greenhouse emissions as climate talks in Madrid hit an intense phase. We need to have the big emitters understanding that their role is essential, because if the big emitters fail, everything will fail,"" Guterres told Reuters in an interview. ""If we just go on as we are, we are doomed."" He was speaking in a hangar-like conference centre in Madrid where ministers from around the world are cloistered in the final days of two-week talks to shore up the 2015 Paris Agreement to avert catastrophic global warming. Major polluting countries such as China, India and the United States - which is leaving the pact - are not expected to make big new announcements at the summit, where delegates are focused on technical negotiations over rules on carbon markets. Nevertheless, Guterres hopes the talks will conclude on Friday with a strong signal that governments are ready to submit more ambitious climate plans in 2020, seen as a make-or-break year for the Paris process. Under the deal, countries are supposed to submit more stringent targets to cut carbon emissions in the run-up to the next annual round of talks in Glasgow. Scientists say that current pledges are nowhere near enough to stabilise the earth's climate in time to avert catastrophic sea-level rise, prevent severe damage to agriculture, and stop droughts and floods generating waves of forced mass migration. Guterres urged major emitters to send a clear signal they are ready to increase their ambition next year and ""hopefully"" commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - seen as vital to keeping global temperatures within manageable levels. ""History cannot accept that my generation will betray our children and grandchildren,"" said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, who has made climate a signature issue since taking over as UN secretary-general in early 2017. Guterres welcomed moves by the European Union to adopt a new ""European Green Deal"" to transition to a low-carbon economy. Details of the policy were being unveiled in Brussels on Wednesday to coincide with the UN climate summit. ""It is always essential that someone starts,"" Guterres said. ""If Europe will do so, that I think will be a very important contribution for others to consider the same kind of commitment. If no-one starts, then there is no chance."""""
Climate activist Greta Thunberg is Time's 2019 person of the year,11 Dec 2019 09:34PM (Updated: 12 Dec 2019 08:46AM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-time-2019-person-of-the-year-12176880," NEW YORK: Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swede who inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change, has been named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. Thunberg launched a grassroots campaign at the age of 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Swedish parliament, pushing for her government to meet its ambitious goals to curb carbon emissions. Her actions quickly captured people's imagination, and in September this year millions of people took to the streets in cities across the world to support her cause.   The magazine interviewed Thunberg aboard the sailboat that took her from the United States to Europe after a hectic 11-week North American trip to several US cities and Canada. In the 16 months since (her protests began), she has addressed heads of state at the UN, met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike,"" the magazine said. ""Margaret Atwood compared her to Joan of Arc. After noticing a hundredfold increase in its usage, lexicographers at Collins Dictionary named Thunberg’s pioneering idea, climate strike, the word of the year."" It added: ""The politics of climate action are as entrenched and complex as the phenomenon itself, and Thunberg has no magic solution."" ""But she has succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change. ""She has offered a moral clarion call to those who are willing to act, and hurled shame on those who are not."" Thunberg, who turns 17 in January, is currently in Madrid at a United Nations climate summit where world leaders are wrangling over how to implement a 2015 Paris agreement designed to avert potentially catastrophic global warming. She was typically blunt in her assessment of politicians' efforts. ""It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition,"" she said on stage, drawing applause from an audience that included dozens of her supporters. ""I'm sure that if people heard what was going on and what was said ... during these meetings, they would be outraged."" Former US Vice President Al Gore, a longtime environmentalist, said the magazine made a ""brilliant choice"" in choosing the reluctant celebrity. ""Greta embodies the moral authority of the youth activist movement demanding that we act immediately to solve the climate crisis. She is an inspiration to me and to people across the world,"" Gore said. Thunberg's stance on climate change has brought her into confrontation with some of the world's most powerful people. A video of her giving US President Donald Trump what media described as a ""death stare"" at a UN climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and has challenged every major US regulation aimed at combating climate change. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro this week called Thunberg a ""brat"" after she criticized mounting violence against indigenous people in which two Amazon tribesmen were shot dead. The activist retorted by changing the biographical description on her Twitter account to ""Pirralha,"" the Portuguese word Bolsonaro used to insult her. Other nominees for Time's person of the year included Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."""
Activist Thunberg denounces 'creative PR' in climate fight,11 Dec 2019 05:55PM (Updated: 11 Dec 2019 07:07PM),Reuters/nr/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greta-thunberg-climate-change-united-nation-summit-12176234," MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at a United Nations summit on Wednesday (Dec 11). It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition,"" the 16-year-old Swede told the meeting in Madrid, drawing applause. ""I still believe the biggest danger is not inaction, the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" she added. Politicians in Madrid are grappling with outstanding issues in the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to avert catastrophic global warming, including the spiny issue of accounting for carbon emissions. Many countries and companies are relying on the idea of carbon markets to meet goals to cut greenhouse gas output and help limit temperature rises to between 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Supporters of carbon markets say they can serve to lower the cost of reducing emissions and enable countries to commit to more ambitious targets. Others see them as a way to stall more aggressive action to cut emissions. Thunberg said many pledges to balance out emissions in this way did not include the impact of shipping, aviation and international trade, and called for quicker action. ""Zero in 2050 means nothing if high emission continues even for a few years,"" said Thunberg, who has become a symbol of youth anger against older generations and the political classes for foot-dragging over the environmental crisis. ""To stay below 1.5 degrees we need to keep the carbon in the ground."""""

Kerry, who served as the top US diplomat under President Barack Obama and was a leading player in brokering the Paris Agreement in 2015, said the G20 nations are lagging behind on emission reduction plans and financial pledges to poor countries instead of setting a high bar for global climate action. ""The burden falls largely on the G20 to behave like adults, like great nations ought to,"" Kerry told Reuters on the sidelines of the UN climate talks in Madrid, referring to a grouping of top industrial economies. ""We are at a critical stage in terms of being behind (our targets) and the absence of US leadership is one component,"" he said. Environment ministers from over 190 countries have arrived in Madrid for the high-level part of the COP25 UN climate talks, where government officials will take over from technical experts the negotiation of outstanding issues around the Paris Agreement to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. While the Trump administration has started the process to withdraw the United States - the world's biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions - from the Paris agreement next year, dozens of US mayors and CEOs have maintained a presence in Madrid as part of the ""We Are Still In"" coalition - a group of states and cities that are still committed to Paris goals. Former New York Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, who funds the initiative, arrived in Madrid on Tuesday trying to convince other countries that the United States is still a leader on climate change action despite Trump's withdrawal. ""We want the rest of the world to know that Americans are continuing to lead on climate change - even with a climate denier in the White House,"" he said. Negotiators worked late in the night on Monday to hash out rules guiding the use of carbon trading markets to achieve Paris emission reduction targets. They are also grappling with how to address ""loss and damage,"" a mechanism to compensate vulnerable countries that have been struck by climate impacts."""
World needs to work together to tackle 'existential challenge' of climate change: Masagos,10 Dec 2019 07:58PM (Updated: 10 Dec 2019 08:24PM),CNA/hm,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/world-needs-to-work-together-to-tackle-existential-challenge-of-12172820," MADRID: At a time when multilateralism is under strain, the world needs to strengthen global and regional cooperation to address the “existential challenge” of climate change, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Tuesday (Dec 10). “Like all small island states, Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of global warming. We strongly echo the call by many for more action and collaboration,” he said at the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid. Mr Masagos also reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming as he delivered Singapore’s national statement at the summit. The conference, which opened last Monday, hopes to resolve issues in implementing the Paris accord, where countries had set goals to cut carbon emissions. Singapore will play its part and update its post-2020 climate actions as agreed under the accord, the minister said. The country had pledged to reduce its emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise its emissions with the aim of peaking around that year. “We will also work with others to support the efforts of developing countries,” he added. He urged countries to finalise the mechanisms under Paris Agreement which will allow them to cooperate in reducing carbon emissions. “It is imperative that we adopt a credible, clear and coherent set of rules to govern the effective use of international carbon credits,” he said. SINGAPORE’S CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION Outlining Singapore’s actions so far, he said that the nation has implemented a carbon tax, and the revenue from that will be used to help companies become more resource and energy efficient, as well as support projects to reduce emissions. It has also adopted a Zero Waste Masterplan and a Resource Sustainability Act to build a “circular economy” – an economic system aimed at eliminating waste. More on Singapore’s efforts and plans were detailed in a full national statement from Mr Masagos which was submitted to the UN. The use of solar energy will be ramped up, the statement said. Solar installations have increased a hundred-fold from 30 to more than 3,000 in Singapore over the last decade. Singapore will continue to find ways to get around its land constraints, such as using floating solar panels, the minister said, adding that the country aims to increase its 2020 solar target by more than five times to at least 2GWp by 2030. Authorities had earlier announced that this represents 4 per cent of Singapore’s current electricity demand. Singapore is also exploring other energy options such as using regional power grids, and has commissioned studies to evaluate the feasibility of alternatives such as hydrogen and carbon capture technology which can use the gasses to produce electricity. A LOW-CARBON FUTURE In his full statement, Mr Masagos said that the Government also has plans to make transport in the city greener by 2040. Twenty years down the road, nine out of every 10 peak-period journeys will be made by walking, cycling or on public transport, the statement said. Singapore also aims to have 100 per cent cleaner energy public bus fleets by 2040. Singapore pledged to actively support international efforts to address the emissions of the aviation and maritime transport sectors. As a financial hub, Singapore has also issued more than US$4.4 billion (S$6 billion) of greed bonds to date. The Singapore Government will help ease the transition to a “climate-resilient” economy and help workers adapt to a low-carbon future, but Mr Masagos emphasised the need for strong multilateral action in the fight against climate change. One example of Singapore’s efforts is its support of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility to improve pre-disaster planning, disaster relief and reconstruction funding in the region. “To succeed in our efforts to address climate change, we need to work hand-in-hand with youths, businesses and civil organisations to co-create and co-deliver solutions to solve our environmental challenges,” he said. The minister accepted an invitation from Chilean COP 25 president Carolina Schmidt to be a co-facilitator with Spanish minister Teresa Ribera Rodriguez on the overarching decision texts for the conference. The role involves canvassing views and inputs on the key decisions of issues that the parties would like to see adopted at COP 25, as well as presenting draft decisions."
Dancing crowds protest in Madrid while climate leaders meet,08 Dec 2019 05:27AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/dancing-crowds-protest-in-madrid-while-climate-leaders-meet-12164504," MADRID: Hundreds of people blocked one of Madrid's most emblematic streets on Saturday by dancing to demand action against climate change in what protesters dubbed civil disco-bedience. The protest, called by grassroots green movement Extinction Rebellion, blocked the central shopping street Gran Via. Activists waved flags and danced to songs including the Bee Gees 1977 classic Stayin' Alive. We've tried all the normal safe ways - petitions, marches, writing letters to the politicians, so now all we can do is civil disobedience,"" Joan, an Australian who has been living in Madrid for 18 months, told Reuters. ""We're here on Gran Via in Madrid doing civil disco-bedience,"" she added as protesters danced around her. Despite the cool winter temperatures, some of the demonstrators danced topless along the street. The protest coincides with Madrid hosting the annual U.N. climate summit, which opened last Monday with a call from U.N. chief Antonio Guterres not to be the ""generation ... that fiddled while the planet burned"". By the meeting's close on Dec. 13, negotiators hope to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement an accord struck in Paris in 2015 to avert catastrophic global warming."""
Marine life under threat from plummeting oxygen levels,07 Dec 2019 05:13PM (Updated: 07 Dec 2019 05:20PM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/marine-life-under-threat-plummeting-oxygen-levels-12163508," MADRID: The loss of oxygen from the ocean due to climate change risks dire effects"" on sea life, fisheries and coastal communities, a global conservation body said Saturday (Dec 7). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said that around 700 sites had been identified globally with low oxygen levels - up from only 45 in the 1960s. In the same period, the group warned, the volume of anoxic waters - areas totally devoid of oxygen - have quadrupled. The ocean absorbs around a quarter of all fossil fuel emissions, but as global energy demand continues to grow there are fears that the world's seas will eventually reach saturation point. Oceans are expected on current trends to lose 3.0 to 4.0 per cent of their oxygen globally by 2100. However, most of that loss is predicted to be in the upper 1,000m, that is the richest part of the ocean for biodiversity. ""With this report, the scale of damage climate change is wreaking upon the ocean comes into stark focus,"" said IUCN acting director Grethel Aguilar. ""As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray."" The largest peer-reviewed study to date on ocean oxygen loss concluded that deoxygenation is already altering the balance of marine life to the detriment of species that need more of the life-giving gas. Species such as tuna, marlin and sharks - many of which are already endangered - are particularly sensitive to low oxygen levels due to their large size and energy demands. But loss of oxygen is affecting species across the food chain. The biomes that support around a fifth of the world's current fish catch are formed by ocean currents that bring oxygen-poor water in to coastlines. These areas are especially vulnerable to even tiny variations in oxygen levels. ""Impacts here will ultimately ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people,"" the IUCN said. The group this year issued a landmark assessment of the world's natural habitats, concluding starkly that human activity was threatening up to one million species with extinction. Ocean life is already battling warmer temperatures, rampant overfishing and plastic pollution. The World Meterological Organisation this week said that due to man-made emissions growth, the ocean is now 26 per cent more acidic than before the Industrial Revolution. CLIMATE CHANGE, POLLUTION ""Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification,"" said Dan Laffoley, a senior marine science adviser at the IUCN. ""To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas, we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources."" The IUCN report also found that pollution around coastlines was having a significant effect on oxygen levels, with fertiliser and agricultural run off promoting more algae growth, which in turn depletes oxygen as it decomposes. World leaders will gather in Marseille in June for the IUCN's World Conservation Congress. Policymakers are currently in negotiations at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid charged with ratifying a comprehensive rulebook for the 2015 Paris accord. ""Decisions taken at the ongoing climate conference will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly and irrevocably lost,"" said IUCN global marine and polar programme director Minna Epps."""
Activist Thunberg completes intercontinental dash to Madrid climate summit,06 Dec 2019 05:08PM,Reuters/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/activist-thunberg-completes-intercontinental-dash-to-madrid-climate-summit-12160072," MADRID: Teenage activist Greta Thunberg pulled in on the overnight train to Madrid on Friday (Dec 6), heading to a gathering of world leaders she says are failing to combat climate change. In just over a year, Thunberg has inspired younger protesters in a global movement demanding action to slow the atmospheric warming that climate scientists say could ultimately endanger the survival of industrial societies. Stepping off the night train Lusitania at Chamartin train station in the Spanish capital, the 16-year-old Swede completed a hastily arranged expedition, including a 21-day catamaran voyage across the Atlantic, to a UN conference originally planned in Santiago, Chile. Thunberg was met by a crowd of reporters but did not speak as she left the train. I successfully managed to sneak into Madrid this morning! I don't think anyone saw me ... Anyway it's great to be in Spain!"" Thunberg tweeted after leaving the station. The Lusitania, which runs daily, is the only direct train link between Lisbon and Madrid and takes nine hours to travel overnight between the capitals. The annual summit kicked off on Monday with a call from UN chief Antonio Guterres not to be the ""generation ... that fiddled while the planet burned"". Thunberg is due to take part in a mass march and make a speech later in Madrid. At the last UN climate event in September, she harangued delegates, demanding: ""How dare you?"" and declaring, ""You have stolen my dreams."" By this meeting's close on Dec 13, negotiators hope to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement an agreement struck in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. They saved the deal from disintegrating last year by agreeing guidelines for putting it into effect, but current pledges fall well short of the temperature target and sticking points remain among signatories. President Donald Trump has started the process of withdrawing the United States, the top historic greenhouse gas emitter, from the accord. Spain has said a desire to prevent this move from sapping morale around the project was one of its reasons for offering to host after riots over inequality prompted Chile to withdraw. The Chilean delegation remains responsible for presiding over the negotiations."""
'Mega fire' forms north of Sydney,06 Dec 2019 03:27PM (Updated: 07 Dec 2019 01:54AM),AFP/nh/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/mega-fire-forms-north-of-sydney-12159340," SYDNEY: Several Australian bushfires have combined to form a mega fire"" that is burning out of control across a swathe of land north of Sydney, authorities said on Friday (Dec 7), warning they cannot contain the blaze. New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers said ""there are probably more than eight fires in all"" that have merged to form what has been dubbed a ""mega fire"" in an area of national park forest. The blaze was burning across 300,000 hectares - an area roughly 60 kilometres across - within an hour's drive of Australia's largest city, which was again subsumed in a soup of toxic smoke. ""There is just fire that whole way"" said Rogers, who added that firefighters could do little more than get any residents out, protect property and hope for an end to fire-friendly dry and windy conditions. We ""cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them,"" he told public broadcaster ABC. ""The best thing we can do is try to protect property and people as much as we can."" Prolonged drought has left much of eastern Australia tinder-dry and spot fires have raged every day for the past three months. Bushfires are common in Australia but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought and climatic conditions fuelled by global warming. Dramatic footage of firefighters running from a wall of fire ripping through the tree canopy above them was captured overnight in Orangeville, less than 100 kilometres west of Sydney. The local fire and rescue team that shot the images said no one was injured and the vehicles surrounded by the swirling embers also survived the blaze. ""The video was put up to demonstrate why you need to listen to the fire advisory system,"" the team from Ingleburn fire station said on Facebook. ""If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and your (sic) not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away,"" they warned. At a wildlife park in the area, 300 animals were evacuated. Walkabout Wildlife Park said it had shipped out lizards, dingoes, peacocks and marsupials, as firefighters battled more than 100 fires up and down the eastern seaboard. ""This fire has been doing some crazy things, so we have to be prepared,"" general manager Tassin Barnard told AFP. New South Wales rural fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons said some US and Canadian firefighters had arrived to help out. The specialists are expected to supervise waterbombing planes and heavy equipment used in creating fire containment lines. ""We are not only appreciative of their presence here today, but of their sacrifice,"" said Fitzsimmons - who has become a fixture on Australian television screens for weeks, updating the public on blazes in towns, national parks and backwaters. ""They are volunteering to sacrifice time from loved ones, from families, to give up that special time of the year around Christmas and New Year to come down here and lend us a hand,"" he said. More than 600 homes have been destroyed and six people have died since the crisis began in September. That is many fewer than Australia's deadliest recent fire season in 2009 when almost 200 people died, but 2019's toll so far belies the scale of devastation. An estimated two million hectares have burned - the size of some small countries - across a region spanning hundreds of kilometres. The fires have taken a toll in Sydney and other major cities, which have been blanketed in toxic smoke for weeks and occasionally sprinkled with snow-like embers. Fitzsimmons said he could not ""overstate the effect that this profound drought is having"" as he warned of a long, painful summer ahead. ""There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation ... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely."""""
"GM, LG Chem to build US$2.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Ohio",05 Dec 2019 05:55PM (Updated: 06 Dec 2019 09:20AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/gm--lg-chem-to-build-us-2-3-billion-electric-vehicle-battery-plant-in-ohio-12156086," WARREN, Mich.: General Motors Co and South Korea's LG Chem said on Thursday they will invest US$2.3 billion to build an electric vehicle battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities. The plant, to be built near GM's closed assembly plant in Lordstown in northeast Ohio, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said. Construction is to begin in mid-2020 and the plant will have an annual capacity of more than 30 gigawatt hours with the flexibility to expand. At a media briefing, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the 50-50 joint venture with LG Chem is aimed at dramatically enhancing electric vehicle affordability and profitability."" Barra said the Ohio battery plant will accelerate the automaker's initiative to introduce 20 new electric vehicles globally by 2023. ""General Motors believes in the science of global warming and believes in an all-electric future,"" she said. Barra said the battery cells will be used in a GM electric pickup which will start production in fall 2021 at the company's Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which eventually will ""have more than one product."" In October, Reuters reported the Detroit-Hamtramck plant is expected to build at least four different electric vehicles, including an SUV for Cadillac and a pickup for GMC. The Ohio battery cell plant will boost LG Chem's global battery capacity to 100 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2020, LG Chem CEO Hak-Cheol Shin said at the briefing. Each company will invest about US$916 million, with the rest coming from debt capital raised by joint venture, a GM spokeswoman said. Electric vehicle industry suppliers were cheered by the news, especially GM's talk of an EV truck as pickups and SUVs are the heart of the U.S. market. LG Chem's cross-town rival SK Innovation , which counts Volkswagen and Daimler among its customers, broke ground in March on a US$1.7 billion EV battery factory in Commerce, Georgia, about 200 km from Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant, which will be the automaker's EV hub in the United States. SK Innovation's U.S. factory is scheduled to begin mass production in 2022. ""We’ve been trying to make it clear to everyone that the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain will grow when more (automakers) make more EV trucks here in the country,"" said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium Ltd , which is developing a lithium mine near Charlotte, North Carolina. Lithium is a key material in EV batteries. Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the GM-LG Chem plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn US$15 to US$17 an hour. If so, it would be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla's Nevada battery factory and LG Chem's battery plant in Michigan do not have unions. Barra said the plant's workers would decide whether a union represents them, and said pay would be competitive with other parts plants. The average pay for a UAW worker at GM is about US$31 an hour. Barra said Ohio is providing financial incentives for the plant, but declined to provide details. Ohio became a political lightning rod last year after GM announced plans to close the Lordstown car manufacturing plant. The closure was one issue during a lengthy strike by GM workers, and U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the move. White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro told Reuters he thinks the plant will expand over time and be a significant anchor of employment in Lordstown. ""The battery plant itself is a critical part of GM’s overall strategy to dominate the EV market over the next several decades,"" Navarro said.

Spray-painted polar bear sparks alarm in Russia,04 Dec 2019 08:27PM (Updated: 04 Dec 2019 08:30PM),AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/spray-painted-polar-bear-sparks-alarm-in-russia-12152742," MOSCOW: A video showing a polar bear daubed with painted slogan T-34, the name of a Soviet era tank, has caused alarm in Russia with experts saying it could prevent the bear hunting. Local media reported Tuesday (Dec 3) that scientists had marked the bear because it was scavenging for food near a human-inhabited area in the Arctic region. The video was posted on Facebook on Monday by Sergei Kavry, who works for the World Wildlife Fund in the Chukotka region. He said he was concerned at the large letters daubed on the side of the bear, seen plodding through snow. Why? Why? He won't be able to hunt inconspicuously,"" Kavry wrote. Kavry said he found the video on a WhatsApp social media group and did not know where it was shot. A senior researcher at the Institute of Biological Problems of the North in far eastern Russia, Anatoly Kochnev, told RIA Novosti news agency he did not know where the video was shot, but the letters could have been painted on by ""jokers"". ""At first, until he cleans himself off, it will be hard for him to hunt,"" the scientist said. Severpress news agency, based in the Yamalo-Nenetsky region, some 2,000km northeast of Moscow, reported that the marks were put on by an expedition of scientists on Novaya Zemlya, a remote and sparsely populated Arctic archipelago. It cited experts as saying a team of scientists from Moscow went to investigate a polar bear that was raiding a settlement's rubbish tip and they marked the bear to see if it returned. The agency quoted Ilya Mordvintsev, a senior researcher from Moscow's Institute of Problems of Ecology and Evolution, as saying the expedition members caught the bear and sedated it. Finding the animal was well-fed and therefore would not attack humans, they took it to a safe distance from the settlement and marked it with paint that would wash off in two weeks, to see if it returned to scavenge, he said. The video was apparently shot last week, the agency reported. Polar bears regularly visit areas inhabited by humans in Arctic Russia to search for food, often in rubbish tips. In February in Novaya Zemlya, officials sounded the alarm over an ""invasion"" of 52 bears in the main settlement there. The bears are affected by global warming with melting Arctic ice forcing them to spend more time on land where they compete for food."""
Climate activist Greta Thunberg reaches Lisbon on way to Madrid summit,03 Dec 2019 10:08PM (Updated: 03 Dec 2019 10:08PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-reaches-lisbon-on-way-to-madrid-summit-12148974," LISBON: Climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived in Lisbon on Tuesday (Dec 3) after crossing the Atlantic from New York aboard a catamaran ahead of her appearance at a summit in Madrid to demand urgent action on global warming. The boat, La Vagabonde, carried the Swedish campaigner, who refuses to travel by plane, across the ocean so she could attend the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She will spend the day holding meetings with Portuguese climate activists and resting before her departure for Madrid. More than 150 supporters turned out to greet Thunberg as she came ashore. Among them was the leader of Portugal's People Animals Nature party, Andre Silva, who praised Thunberg for her role in tackling the greatest crisis of our times"". ""She is prioritising an increasingly urgent issue in a way politicians just aren’t,"" he told Reuters. Her arrival in Lisbon coincides with the release of a bleak report by the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organisation, which warns that the past decade is almost certain to be the hottest yet recorded. Portugal’s environment minister Matos Fernandes thanked Greta for her activism in a letter last Thursday, having already departed for COP25. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said it was a ""great pleasure"" to have her in Lisbon but did not feel it was his place to personally greet the activist. Thunberg missed last Friday’s climate strike as heavy winds delayed her arrival in Lisbon but she is due to join thousands of activists marching in Madrid on Friday afternoon on the fringes of the COP25. The conference kicked off on Monday with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that the planet had reached a ""point of no return"". Top priorities include establishing a common time frame for countries to implement their national climate commitment plans, and resolving the issue of international carbon markets. That issue is the only one from the Paris rule book endorsed in 2015 which delegates failed to agree at last year’s COP24 in Poland."""
"2010s hottest decade in history, UN says as emissions rise again",03 Dec 2019 04:54PM (Updated: 03 Dec 2019 08:31PM),AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2010s-hottest-decade-in-history-un-emissions-climate-change-12148054," MADRID: This decade is set to be the hottest in history, the United Nations said on Tuesday (Dec 3) in an annual assessment outlining the ways in which climate change is outpacing humanity's ability to adapt to it. The World Meterological Organization said global temperatures so far this year were 1.1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average, putting 2019 on course to be in the top three warmest years ever recorded. Man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels, building infrastructure, growing crops and transporting goods mean 2019 is set to break the record for atmospheric carbon concentrations, locking in further warming, the WMO said. Oceans, which absorb 90 per cent of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gases, are now at their highest recorded temperatures. The world's seas are now a quarter more acidic than 150 years ago, threatening vital marine ecosystems upon which billions of people rely for food and jobs. In October, the global mean sea level reached its highest on record, fuelled by the 329 billion tonnes of ice lost from the Greenland ice sheet in 12 months. UP TO 22 MILLION DISPLACED Each of the last four decades has been hotter than the last. And far from climate change being a phenomenon for future generations to confront, the effects of humanity's insatiable, growth-at-any cost consumption means millions are already counting the damage. The report said more than 10 million people were internally displaced in the first half of 2019 - seven million directly due to extreme weather events such as storms, flooding and drought.   By the end of the year, the WMO said new displacements due to weather extremes could reach 22 million. Once again in 2019 weather and climate related risks hit hard,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""Heatwaves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences."" At just 1 degree Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, 2019 has already seen deadly heatwaves in Europe, Australia and Japan, superstorms devastate southeast Africa, and wildfires rage out of control in Australia and California. 'NOT ADAPTING' Nations are currently in crucial talks in Madrid aimed at finalising rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which enjoins countries to work to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year outlined how vital it was for mankind to aim for a safer cap of 1.5 degree Celsius - ideally by slashing greenhouse gas emissions and retooling the global economy towards renewable energy. The UN said last week in its annual ""emissions gap"" assessment that the world needed to cut carbon emissions by 7.6 per cent each year, every year, until 2030 to hit 1.5 degree Celsius. Instead, emissions are rising.   And while governments spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidising fossil fuels, there appears to be no consensus in Madrid over how countries already dealing with climate-related catastrophe can fund efforts to adapt to the new reality. ""Our economic activities continue to use the atmosphere as a waste dump for greenhouse gases,"" said Joeri Rogelj, Grantham Lecturer in Climate Change at Imperial College London. ""The increasing temperatures, the warming oceans, ocean acidification and other indicators are the logical consequence of this inaction and this should worry us deeply."" Even if all Paris pledges were honoured, Earth is still on course to be more than 3 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of the century. ""There is no indication of a fade out of the warming,"" Taalas told reporters. ""The numbers will be higher if we continue our current behaviour."" Part of the discussions in Madrid is aimed at getting countries to increase their climate action ambition ahead of a deadline next year. Friederike Otto, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute, said the WMO report ""highlights that we are not even adapted to 1.1 degree of warming."" ""And there is no doubt that this 1.1 degree is due to the burning of fossil fuels,"" he said. Christian Aid's global climate lead Kat Kramer said the WMO report showed the need for concrete progress in Madrid. ""Delegates have no excuse to block progress or drag their feet when the science is showing how urgently action is needed,"" she said."""
New facility to produce up to 5 million Wolbachia mosquitoes weekly in fight against dengue,02 Dec 2019 08:08PM (Updated: 02 Dec 2019 11:47PM),CNA/cc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wolbachia-mosquitoes-new-facility-aedes-aegypti-dengue-12145012," SINGAPORE: A new S$5 million mosquito production facility opened on Monday (Dec 2), as part of the National Environment Agency's (NEA) latest efforts to combat dengue. This comes in the wake of a surge of dengue cases in Singapore this year, with close to 15,000 cases and 20 deaths reported, said Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor, who spoke at the opening. Dr Khor said that global warming and climate change would likely worsen Singapore's dengue situation. This is because mosquitoes breed faster at higher temperatures, and the dengue virus also replicates faster, allowing it to be transmitted more efficiently,"" she said. With 10 times the production capability of NEA's previous Neythal Road facility, the new Ang Mo Kio facility hopes to eventually produce five million mosquitoes a week, crucial to helping NEA meet its goal of expanding Project Wolbachia field trials.   Project Wolbachia involves infecting male aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria, so that when it mates with a female, the eggs will not hatch. Male Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes also do not bite. Project Wolbachia entered its fourth phase in November 2019, expanding trials to 284 residential blocks at Tampines West and Nee Soon East. Previously, phase 3 covered 144 residential blocks in the same areas and achieved a 90 per cent suppression rate. HIGHLY AUTOMATED FACILITY The new facility at Techplace II involves the use of automation to drastically reduce the time needed to produce male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes. The devices will free up the time spent on ""tedious and repetitive work"", said NEA CEO Tan Meng Dui on Monday.   A larvae counter will reduce the time needed to count larvae manually by up to 40 times, while a pupae sorter will reduce the time needed to separate male and female pupae manually by up to 20 times. Other technologies such as an automated feeding system, a compact rearing rack to grow pupae and a mosquito launcher helps NEA officers to increase the number of mosquitoes harvested and released in a shorter period of time. There is also a water recycling system that allows NEA to recover up to 70 per cent of waste water from the facility. ""This facility serves multiple functions,"" said Mr Tan. ""Besides providing us with the scalability we need to expand male Wolbachia-aedes mosquito releases, it also serves as an incubator and test bed for innovative solutions, and provides a space for learning and mutual exchange of ideas.""   A system to inject low-dose radiation into Wolbachia-aedes aegypti female mosquitoes was also developed in conjunction with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The radiation will make any Wolbachia-carrying females that are accidentally sorted with male pupae infertile, as the Project Wolbachia technology depends on breeding Wolbachia-carrying males with non-Wolbachia-carrying females.   While effective, Dr Khor noted that Wolbachia technology is not ""a silver bullet for dengue control"". ""Wolbachia is meant to enhance, not replace, our existing vector control strategies, which are focused on source reduction,"" she said."""
United Nations opens two-week climate change summit in Madrid,02 Dec 2019 04:36PM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/united-nation-climate-change-summit-madrid-12144504," MADRID: The United Nations opened a two-week climate summit in Madrid on Monday (Dec 1), where world leaders face growing pressure to prove they can muster the political will to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. The talks began against a backdrop of increasingly visible impacts from rising temperatures in the past year, with wildfires raging from the Arctic and the Amazon to Australia, and tropical regions hit by devastating hurricanes. Michal Kurtyka, Poland's climate minister who led the last round of UN climate negotiations in the Polish city of Katowice in December last year, said a surge in climate activism among young people underscored the urgency of the task. Maybe the world is not moving yet at the pace we would like but my hope is still particularly with the young people,"" Kurtyka told the official opening ceremony of the talks at a vast conference centre in Madrid. ""They have the courage to speak up and remind us that we inherited this planet from our parents, and we need to hand it over to the future generations,"" Kurtyka said. The conference aims to lay the final pieces of groundwork needed to support the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Existing pledges made under the accord fall far short of the kind of action needed to avert the most disastrous consequences of global warming in terms of sea-level rise, drought, storms and other impacts, scientists say."""
Europe to consider law on climate neutrality by March,29 Nov 2019 09:59PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/europe-to-consider-law-on-climate-neutrality-by-march-12138742," BRUSSELS: The European Union (EU) executive will propose by March 2020 a new climate law to turn the bloc neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and help lead the planet's struggle against global warming, a draft showed on Friday (Nov 29). The European Commission document, to be published on Dec 11 and seen by Reuters, also said it would by next October present a plan to halve the bloc's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Anxiety is growing around the world that governments are not doing enough to reach the Paris Agreement's target of curbing emissions sufficiently to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. The 28-nation EU, where floods and heatwaves of recent years have been increasingly linked to climate change, says it wants to be at the forefront of action. But there are divisions. Some EU countries dependent on coal for energy like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, oppose the 2050 carbon neutral target, arguing they need help transforming energy production. To win them over, the Commission, whose proposed laws require consent of members and the EU parliament, wants to create a just transition fund"" to wean economies off coal. It did not specify any financial details. The draft document also said the EU executive would propose extending the bloc's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to the maritime sector and possibly road transport, plus reducing free carbon dioxide allowances for airlines. The Commission said it would push for a shift from road and aviation transport to rail, try to ensure that 75 per cent of road transport is moved to other means, and deploy alternative infrastructure and fuels. Moreover, the EU also wants to create sustainability criteria for batteries, launch a forest restoration plan and strengthen requirements for monitoring air pollution in cities. The Commission, whose incoming head Ursula von der Leyen is prioritising the environment, wants to earmark a yet unspecified amount of money in the EU's next long-term budget from 2021 to support clean public transport and take action in ports to clean up ships' emissions. The draft said the EU executive would present an action plan on financing the shift to a greener economy in June 2020 and make sure every future trade agreement includes an ambitious dedicated chapter on sustainable development."""
Mumbai slum-dwellers by the sea live at the mercy of climate change,29 Nov 2019 08:29PM,Reuters/ga,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/mumbai-slum-dwellers-by-the-sea-live-at-the-mercy-of-climate-change-12138698," MUMBAI: Already at risk from rains, flooding and open sewers, slum-dwellers who live by the ocean in the Indian financial capital Mumbai are vulnerable to rising seas caused by global warming and say the government should help them move to safer locations. Thousands of people, mostly migrants from other parts of the country, live in temporary shelters, built on rocks at the edge of the sea and are likely to be the first hit from coastal flooding caused by climate change. Even hearing about (the rising sea levels) we feel afraid. What do we do? We have been living here for so many years. It would be good if the government could do something to help us,"" said Kamakshi Tangesh Devender, who lives in a slum in Worli neighbourhood. Climate change poses a greater threat to poor communities in developing nations like India, Indonesia and the Philippines, with people living on the margins less able to protect themselves from the impact.   A research paper last month by Climate Central, a US-based non-profit climate science and news organisation, found that climate change will put an estimated 300 million people globally at risk of coastal flooding by 2050. The UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report in September that sea levels could rise by 1m by 2100 — 10 times the rate in the 20th century — if carbon emissions that are responsible for climate change keep climbing. ""Mumbai is going to be under water, we need to plan for that eventuality and what is required is to plan a new city to replace Mumbai as and when it gets submerged. And ideally, to my mind, it should be somewhere inland – at a pretty substantial elevation,"" Debi Goenka, an environmental activist, told Reuters. As well as changing sea levels, scientists say climate change is causing an increase in extreme weather events around the world such as drought and floods. Mumbai has been hit this year by incessant rains and flooding, causing loss of life and property and halting essential services like local transport. The city received 66per cent more rainfall than average during the June to September monsoon season, breaking a record set in 1954. Governments are meeting at a UN summit on climate change in Madrid on Dec 2-13."""
"Europeans fear climate change more than terrorism, unemployment or migration",28 Nov 2019 11:25PM,Reuters/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/europeans-fear-climate-change-more-than-terrorism--unemployment-or-migration-12135860," BRUSSELS: Almost half of all Europeans fear climate change more than losing a job or of a terrorist attack, a study by the European Investment Bank (EIB) showed on Thursday (Nov 28) as EU lawmakers declared a climate emergency"". The symbolic vote by lawmakers was designed to pressure for action against global warming at an upcoming United Nations summit. The EIB survey of 30,000 respondents from 30 countries, including China and the United States, showed 47 per cent of Europeans saw climate change as the number one threat in their lives, above unemployment, large scale migration and concerns about terrorism. ""European citizens are highly concerned about climate change and its impact on their everyday life and future,"" said Emma Navarro, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and the environment. ""Interestingly, many of them are optimistic about the possibility to reverse it. Unfortunately, science says otherwise. We have one shot at limiting global warming and mitigating its effects,"" she said. The EIB, owned by European Union governments, is the world's largest international public lending institution and has the task of financing climate-change related investment that is a priority for the new European Commission. The survey, the first of four planned by the EIB, showed the level of concern about climate change was even higher in China than the EU, with 73 per cent of respondents seeing it as the biggest threat to society, compared to 39 per cent in the United States, where most people worried more about access to health services. The study also showed that 41 per cent of young Europeans between the age of 15 and 29, especially from southern countries like Spain, Greece and France thought they would have to move to another country because of the changing climate. ""Overall, 82 per cent of Europeans report that climate change has an impact on their everyday lives, a perception that goes up to 98 per cent in China and 76 per cent in the United States,"" the study said. The incoming European Commission, which will start on Dec 1, wants to make the whole of the European Union an area that is neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 after slashing emissions by 50 per cent by 2030. It still requires the consent of all EU governments before such a target becomes binding, but some countries which still heavily depend on coal like Poland, oppose such ambition."""
Shrinking lake in Mali spells end of line for family of fishermen,27 Nov 2019 04:37PM,Reuters/zl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/shrinking-lake-in-mali-spells-end-of-line-for-family-of-fishermen-12130292," LAC WEGNIA, Mali: Modeste Traore has lived his whole life by Lake Wegnia, in Mali's Sahel region, and its fish have provided him with a livelihood that supports his extended family of 14 children. But as temperatures rise, evaporation increases and the lake shrinks - phenomena experts blame on global climate change - so do the chances of his children following in the fisherman's footsteps. If things go on like this I don't think our children can become fishermen like us,"" the 56-year-old told Reuters, holding one of his young sons on his knee.   ""During the rainy season there is a lot of water but as soon as it's over, there is no water left in the lake. We are fishermen. I don't think our children will be."" Lake Wegnia, or Lac Wegnia in French, is located in the Sahel region of Koulikoro, around 120km north of the capital Bamako. Some 12,000 people including fishermen, farmers and herders depend on it for food, water and income, while its fresh waters and marshes also contain rich biodiversity. But the lake has shrunk by 20 per cent since 2017, according to figures from CIDR (International Centre for Development and Research) and analysis from Hydrosolutions, placing huge pressure on local communities. The United Nations describes the Sahel region - a wide strip of land running across northern Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea - as ""one of the most environmentally degraded regions in the world"".   The organisation has projected temperatures there to increase 1.5 times higher than the global average, and says the Sahel is regularly hit by droughts and floods. Food insecurity, the fight for arable land and fast population growth can lead to conflict, although Lake Wegnia so far has been spared the violence prevalent in other parts of Mali.   Aid group Caritas Suisse and the Eco-Lac Wegnia project it is leading are working to change agricultural practices, improve water management and fight the effects of global warming. Eco-Lac Wegnia's local coordinator Moussa Savagodo said failing to make changes quickly could mean the lake disappears altogether in less than 5 years.   Villagers in Wegnia and Kononi-Sirakoro have already planted 56,000 trees in the last two years and are better managing their water resources by building stone cordons to help the soil retain what rainfall there is. Despite the progress and international support, though, Traore is now raising cattle, because he can't catch enough fish to feed his family.  """

Brand owner Inter IKEA, which is in charge of supply, said it also planned to invest around 100 million euros in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere through reforestation and forest protection. It said the new investments would be part of its work towards IKEA becoming climate positive - to cut more greenhouse gas emissions than the IKEA value chain emits - by 2030. The target includes its around 1,000 direct suppliers. IKEA produces around 10per cent of its range itself and sources the rest from suppliers. In September Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores, pledged to exceed its 2020 target to produce as much renewable energy as the energy it consumes by the year's end. More than 400 firms including IKEA, H&M, Coca-Cola and Sony have committed to a U.N.-backed initiative to help limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius.

China says CO2 border tax will damage global climate change efforts,27 Nov 2019 11:25AM,Reuters/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/eu-carbon-border-tax-china-climate-change-12129108," BEIJING: Proposals by the European Union to establish a carbon border tax"" will damage the global community's willingness to take joint action against climate change, China said on Wednesday (Nov 27). The EU's new climate commissioner Frans Timmermans said in October that research would begin on the new tax, which is aimed at protecting European firms from unfair competition by raising the cost of products from countries that fail to take adequate action against climate change. But Europe's proposals, together with the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement, would seriously harm international efforts to tackle global warming, said Zhao Yingmin, China's vice environment minister, at a briefing on Wednesday. ""We need to send a strong political signal to uphold multilateralism,"" he said. ""We need to prevent unilateralism and protectionism from hurting global growth expectations and the will of countries to combat climate change together."" Any border tax would likely raise the price of Chinese goods in the European market, and Beijing believes it would violate a core principle of the Paris agreement on climate change, which says richer countries should bear the greater responsibility for cutting emissions. As part of its national commitments to the fight against global warming, China - the world's largest emitter of climate warming greenhouse gas - has pledged to bring its emissions to a peak by ""around 2030"". It has also cut levels of carbon intensity - the amount produced per unit of economic growth - by 48.5 per cent from 2005 to 2018, two years ahead of schedule, Zhao said. But the United States says the Paris accord is unfair to US firms because it does not do enough to tackle emissions from competitors in China and India. China's total annual emissions stood at around 14 gigatonnes in 2018, according to a study published by the United Nations this week, more than twice the US level. China's per capita emissions are around the same as Japan and the European Union. China was also making progress on its long-awaited efforts to build a nationwide carbon trading platform, Li Gao, head of the climate change office at the environment ministry, told the briefing, though he did not give a timeframe. China pledged to launch the platform in 2017 as part of its Paris commitments, but it has faced a series of technical difficulties."""
"Slash emissions now or miss 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, UN warns",26 Nov 2019 04:25PM (Updated: 26 Nov 2019 04:30PM),AFP/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-un-emissions-fossil-fuels-12126850," PARIS: The world will miss its chance to avert climate disaster without an immediate and all-but-impossible fall in fossil fuel emissions, the UN said on Tuesday (Nov 26) in its annual assessment on greenhouse gases. The United Nations Environment Programme said that global emissions need to fall by 7.6 per cent each year, every year until 2030 to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The harsh reality is that emissions have risen on average 1.5 per cent annually over the last decade, hitting a record 55.3 billion tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases in 2018 - three years after 195 countries signed the Paris treaty on climate change. The World Meteorological Organization said Monday that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations hit an all-time record in 2018. The Paris deal committed nations to limit temperature rises above pre-industrial levels to well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, and to a safer 1.5 degrees Celsius if at all possible. To do so they agreed on the need to reduce emissions and work towards a low-carbon world within decades. Yet the UN found that even taking into account current Paris pledges, the world is on track for a 3.2 degrees Celsius temperature rise, something scientists fear could tear at the fabric of society.   Even if every country made good on its promises, Earth's ""carbon budget"" for a 1.5-degree Celsius rise - the amount we can emit to stay below a certain temperature threshold - would be exhausted within a decade. In its own words, the UN assessment is ""bleak"". While it insisted the 1.5-degrees Celsius goal is still attainable, it acknowledged that this would require an unprecedented, coordinated upheaval of a global economy that is still fuelled overwhelmingly by oil- and gas-fuelled growth. ""We are failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions,"" UNEP's executive director, Inger Andersen, told AFP. ""Unless we take urgent action now and make very significant cuts to global emissions we're going to miss the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius"" COST OF INACTION The Emissions Gap report, now in its tenth year, also details the cost of a decade of government inaction. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, just after the Copenhagen summit that breathed new life into the debate, annual needed emissions cuts would be 0.7 per cent for 2 degrees Celsius of warming and 3.3 per cent for 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""10 years of climate procrastination has led us to where we are today,"" said Andersen. The report highlighted specific ""opportunities"" for big emitters to push their economies into line with the Paris goals.   While advice varies between countries, the theme is clear: Completely phase out coal, significantly pare back oil and gas, and dramatically build up renewable energy. G20 nations were singled out as laggards: although they produce around 78 per cent of all emissions, only 15 rich nations have outlined plans to reach net-zero. The Trump administration, meanwhile, notified the UN earlier this month that the US will pull out of the Paris treaty, and has taken steps to boost fossil fuel production, including subsidies for technology to capture and store CO2 emissions from power plants. In all, countries must increase their contributions to the climate fight five-fold to deliver the cuts needed for 1.5 degrees Celsius. 'NO SIGN OF PEAK' Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the world's leading scientific body on the subject - issued a stark warning that going beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius would increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, superstorms and mass flooding. With just 1 degrees Celsius of warming so far, 2019 is projected to be the second hottest in human history, a year marred by deadly wildfires and cyclones rendered more frequent as temperatures climb.   And despite the need for urgent action, with global energy demand set to continue rising for years, the UN itself conceded Tuesday that ""there is no sign of (greenhouse) gas emissions peaking in the next few years"". That turning point should have come years ago, said Alden Meyer, director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""We are not running out of time - we are already out of time,"" he told AFP. The report said emissions would need to drop 55 per cent by 2030 to stay on a 1.5 degrees Celsius track - an unprecedented fall at a time of sustained global growth. John Ferguson, director of country analysis at The Economist Intelligence Unity, said he was pessimistic that countries could undertake emissions cuts in the time required. ""There's the emissions gap but there's also the gap between rhetoric and action, and that gap explains my pessimism that we're not going to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius"" he told AFP."""

The UN agency's Greenhouse Gas Bulletin is one of a series of studies to be published ahead of a UN climate change summit being held in Madrid next week, and is expected to guide discussions there. It measures the atmospheric concentration of the gases responsible for global warming, rather than emissions. There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases' concentration in the atmosphere - despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems.""   The concentration of carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels that is the biggest contributor to global warming, surged from 405.5 parts per million in 2017 to 407.8 ppm in 2018, exceeding the average rate of increase of 2.06 ppm in 2005-2015, the WMO report said. Irrespective of future policy, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries, locking in warming trends. ""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago,"" Taalas said. Levels of methane - a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 - and nitrous oxide also hit new records, the report said. The UN Environment Programme's annual ""emissions gap"" report, due on Tuesday, assesses whether countries’ emissions reduction policies are enough."""

Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed he is joining the crowded field of Democrats seeking to take on his fellow New York billionaire, President Donald Trump, just three months before the first primary. There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy,"" said John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg's namesake news agency, in a staff email. He cited the company's policy of not writing about itself or direct competitors. Micklethwait outlined a few editorial changes the agency will make but stressed it would make campaign coverage decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than following an ""exhaustive rulebook"". ""The place where Mike has had the most contact with Editorial is Bloomberg Opinion: our editorials have reflected his views,"" Micklethwait wrote. As a result, the company will end its policy of unsigned editorials. They will also suspend the editorial board, in part because several board members will take leaves of absence to join Bloomberg's campaign. Micklethwait said he intends for the company to cover the campaign's news ""in much the same way as we have done before"", with the exception that articles will explicitly state that Bloomberg News' owner is a candidate. In the email, Micklethwait added that they will not investigate Bloomberg's family or foundations - the same would go for his Democratic rivals - but would publish or summarise investigative pieces on all Democratic candidates. ""Bloomberg News has handled these conflicts before,"" Micklethwait wrote, pointing to Bloomberg's mayoral campaign when the media agency adopted similar coverage policies. Bloomberg is poised to run as a centrist, and analysts suspect that he could take away some of the support enjoyed by fellow moderate Joe Biden. Some believe that his ""self-made man"" image and support for fighting global warming makes him the best challenger for Trump."""
"Natural gas, false hope in climate change campaign?",22 Nov 2019 07:53PM (Updated: 22 Nov 2019 08:00PM),AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/natural-gas-false-hope-in-climate-change-campaign-12118056," PARIS: Natural gas is cleaner and produces fewer global warming emissions than other fossil fuels, making it key to our transition to a low-carbon future, but it comes with its own serious drawbacks. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said recently that natural gas is crucial to its sustainable development model which requires oil and coal use to fall sharply if we are to get anywhere near the Paris agreement climate change targets. Natural gas is relatively cheap, abundant and produces 50 per cent less CO2 than coal, used widely, especially in Asia to generate electricity for fast growing economies. In its latest annual report, the IEA pencilled in a 10 per cent increase in natural gas use through to the end of the 2020s while oil use would have to return to levels last seen in the 1990s. Some NGOs, however, attack the IEA - set up after the first great oil shock in 1973-74 to advise countries how to manage their energy needs - for being overly beholden to nae-say governments such as the United States, and the huge fossil fuel companies. Rather than recommending an increase in the use of natural gas, the IEA should be calling for a reduction, they say. Murray Worthy at Global Witness said governments should not be misled ... and should rather work on closing down existing oil and gas fields, and halting exploration for new reserves."" Significantly, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the lending arm of the European Union, recently announced that it would halt funding new fossil energy projects, including natural gas, from 2022. GOOD AND BAD? For some, natural gas is the ideal transition fuel, with major companies such as Total and Shell producing increasing amounts and launching new projects which stretch for decades into the future. ""When it burns, natural gas releases less CO2, nitrous oxide and sulphur than coal or oil,"" said Nicholas Browne of energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. ""Replacing coal with gas, for example, has had a huge impact on air quality in northern China, with immense benefits in terms of public health,"" Browne said. The question however is ""if gas and LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) are better, are they good enough?"" he added. Extracting and transporting natural gas notably results in significant emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than CO2. ""Methane emissions linked to ... natural gas are largely under-estimated,"" said Cecile Marchand of Friends of the Earth. Taken together, it is not necessarily the case that natural gas is so much better than other fossil fuels, Marchand said, and on that basis, it may ""not allow us to face up to the climate change challenge."" The gas industry is trying to meet these criticism, committing to reducing methane emissions and developing CO2 capture systems in the hope of keeping global warming at manageable levels."""
"Greener, longer life: More trees reduce premature deaths in cities",21 Nov 2019 07:45AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greener--longer-life--more-trees-reduce-premature-deaths-in-cities-12112942," TBILISI - City dwellers tend to live longer if they are in leafy neighborhoods, according to a study published on Wednesday that linked green areas to lower rates of premature death. Trees in cities are already credited with cooling and cleaning the air and absorbing planet-warming gases, now researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health have found they also keep death at bay. More green space is better for health,"" said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, director of the institute's urban planning, environment and health initiative. ""People actually live longer if there is more green space around."" The research, which pulled data from nine other studies involving more than eight million people in seven countries from China to Canada, was the largest ever conducted on the subject, the authors said. Researchers used satellite images to quantify how much vegetation, including trees, grass and shrubs, was within 500 meters (550 yards) of people's homes. Levels of vegetation were ranked on a scale under a system known as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Those involved in the study were followed for several years. Any premature deaths caused by health conditions such as heart or respiratory diseases were factored in. The study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, found that in cities from Barcelona to Perth, a 10per cent increase in greenery led to an average 4per cent reduction in premature mortality. While researchers did not look into specific causes, Nieuwenhuijsen said access to vegetation was known to benefit mental health, reduce stress, cut pollution and encourage physical activity. ""What we need to do is increase green space in many cities ... so that people can actually live a healthy life,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. A ""nice green city"" would have between 20per cent and 30per cent of every area covered in vegetation, he said. With the United Nations estimating two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050, many cities are already looking at ways to increase greenery, according to the C40 network of cities tackling climate change. Medellin in Colombia has planted thousands of trees to form ""green corridors"" along main roads, while Australia's Melbourne was looking to almost double its canopy cover to 40per cent by 2040. ""Green spaces are good for cities and good for citizens,"" Regina Vetter, who manages C40's ""Cool Cities Network"" said in a statement. ""Trees, meadows, wetlands and other green space are also vital to prepare our cities for the impacts of the changing global climate.

"Explainer: From pig power to cleaner stoves, the world of carbon offsets",20 Nov 2019 12:38AM (Updated: 20 Nov 2019 12:38AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/explainer--from-pig-power-to-cleaner-stoves--the-world-of-carbon-offsets-12108658," LONDON: Carbon offsetting, already a multi-billion dollar industry, will get a major boost from the launch of an international scheme to offset aviation emissions, called CORSIA, in 2021. British budget carrier easyJet said on Tuesday it would go further than the scheme by offsetting all of its flights. The global market for offsets of economy flights alone is set to reach US$3.8 billion a year by 2025, analysts at Citi say. Aviation already accounts for some 2per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and green groups have accused the sector of using offsets to try to buy out of the problem cheaply. WHAT IS OFFSETTING AND HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN GOING ON? Carbon offset schemes involve compensating for emissions of the gases which cause global warming by paying for emissions cuts elsewhere. They are measured in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and can be awarded carbon credits. The U.N.’s clean development mechanism (CDM), the first major offsetting scheme, was set up under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which 190 countries agreed country-by-country emission reduction targets. The scheme was designed to help fund emission reduction projects in developing countries, while also providing offset credits to the developed world to help its Kyoto targets. WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS QUALIFY? More than 8,100 projects in 111 countries have registered with the CDM scheme, which has handed out over 2 billion carbon credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), representing 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide reduction. Projects registered under the scheme range from capturing and using methane gasses in pig manure to create electricity to replacing traditional wood and coal burning cookstoves with cleaner alternatives such as ethanol. WHAT ABOUT CARBON SINKS? Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, or REDD, allows developing nations to earn carbon offsets which they can then sell, for projects that preserve or rehabilitate forests. Separately, new forestry and nature based projects generate offsets by planting which absorbs carbon dioxide as it grows. REDD and forestry offsets are verified by organizations such as Verra, a non-profit group founded in 2005 by environmental groups and business to set carbon offset standards. Any carbon offset awarded Gold Standard status must not only show it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions but also that it meets sustainable development goals. The Gold Standard was set up by NGOs such as the World Wildlife Fund. DO THEY WORK? Proponents say offsetting can channel much-needed climate finance to developing countries. Critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and do not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.

"St Mark's Square closed as water again invades Venice, rain lashes Italy",17 Nov 2019 10:41PM (Updated: 18 Nov 2019 08:33AM),AFP/zl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/venice-floods-italy-st-marks-square-closed-pisa-florence-rain-12101810," VENICE: Venice's St Mark's Square was closed on Sunday (Nov 17) as the historic city suffered its third major flooding in less than a week, while rain lashing the rest of Italy prompted warnings in Florence and Pisa. Venice's latest acqua alta"", or high water, hit 150cm on Sunday, lower than Tuesday's 187cm - the highest level in half a century - but still dangerous. ""The water has stopped rising,"" tweeted mayor Luigi Brugnaro, who has estimated damage so far from the invading salt water at more than €1 billion. ""High of 150cm ... Venice is working to restart,"" Brugnaro said after the sea water swamped the already devastated city where authorities have declared a state of emergency.   To the south, Tuscany president Enrico Rossi tweeted a warning of a ""flood wave"" on the Arno and said boards were being installed on the swollen river's banks in Pisa ""as a precautionary measure"". The Italian army tweeted photos of paratroopers helping to bolster river defences in Pisa, with authorities monitoring the same river in Florence after heavy rain made it rise dramatically overnight. Arno flooding devastated Renaissance jewel Florence in 1966, killing around 100 people and destroying thousands of priceless works of art. Civil protection units in Florence advised citizens ""not to stand near the Arno's riverbanks"". Firefighters tweeted footage of a hovercraft being deployed to rescue stranded citizens in southern Tuscany's Grossetano province. BRIEF RESPITE The renewed threat from exceptionally high tides in Venice came after a brief respite on Saturday. Emergency workers removed temporary walkways from St Mark's Square as the water started to rise on Sunday, with only police and soldiers visible at around midday.   The top tourist site had already been shut for several hours on Friday as strong storms and winds battered the region, leaving it submerged by sea surges. Churches, shops and homes have also been inundated in the Renaissance city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city, but the multi-billion euro project has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.   ""We weren't expecting the high waters to be so exceptionally high,"" said Guido Fulgenzi, who had planned to open his cafe on St Mark's square this week. ""We're paying the price"" for the MOSE project not being completed, he said, sloshing around in his flooded kitchen and pointing to Tuesday's high water mark on the wall. The crisis has prompted the government to release €20 million (US$22 million) in funds to tackle the devastation. Culture Minister Dario Franceschini has warned that the task of repairing the city, where more than 50 churches have suffered damage, will be huge. HOTEL RESERVATIONS CANCELLED Residents whose houses have been hit are eligible for up to €5,000 in immediate government aid, while restaurant and shop owners can receive up to €20,000 and apply for more later. Most of the city's cash machines were no longer working, making life even more difficult for tourists and Venetians.   ""We didn't expect there to be so much water, now we're soaked,"" said French tourist Magali Mariolou, visiting Venice for her wedding anniversary. ""We'll come back another year when it's a bit drier. The boots are heavy, they're full of water!"" Older residents who remember the infamous ""acqua alta"" of 1966, when the water rose to 1.94m, say they have not seen such frequent flooding before. Hotels reported cancelled reservations, some as far ahead as December, following the widespread diffusion of images of Venice underwater.   Tuesday's high waters submerged around 80 per cent of the city, officials said. Many, including Venice's mayor, have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that the country prone to natural disasters must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons. The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to 50,000 residents but receives 36 million visitors each year."""
Devastated Venice braced for third major flood,16 Nov 2019 04:33PM (Updated: 17 Nov 2019 07:57AM),AFP/hs/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/devastated-venice-braced-for-third-major-flood-12099838," VENICE: Venice was braced on Saturday (Nov 16) for an unprecednted third major flooding in less than a week, with sea water due to swamp the already devastated historic city where authorities have declared a state of emergency. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro ordered the iconic St Mark's Square closed on Friday as the latest sea surge struck with strong storms and winds battering the region. After a brief respite on Saturday, the city forecast a high water of 160 centimetres (over five feet) for just after midday on Sunday, lower than Tuesday's high of 187 centimetres but still dangerous. Churches, shops and homes in the city, a UNESCO World Heritage site, have been inundated by unusually intense acqua alta"", or high water, which on Tuesday hit its highest level in half a century. ""We've destroyed Venice, we're talking about one billion (euros) in damage,"" Brugnaro said after the second major flooding of around 160 centimetres hit on Friday. The Italian football team travelled to Venice on Saturday to show solidarity with the stricken city. ""On behalf of the whole team, we stand close to the city of Venice,"" said Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian football federation delegation visited several businesses damaged by the flooding, and chatted with Venetians, volunteers and police. ""Venice will overcome this too. Like an athlete who suffers a serious injury and then gets up again,"" said delegation chief and former Azzurri international Gianluca Vialli.   The crisis has prompted the government to release €20 million (US$22 million) in funds to tackle the devastation. Surveying the damage, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini warned the task of repairing the city would be huge. More than 50 churches had suffered damage, he said. HOTEL RESERVATIONS CANCELLED Residents whose houses have been hit are eligible for up to 5,000 euros in immediate government aid, while restaurant and shop owners can receive up to 20,000 euros and apply for more later. Most of the city's cash machines were no longer working because of the water, making life even more difficult for tourists and Venetians. Despite being used to the inconvenience of their city's rising waters, some inhabitants expressed frustration. ""All the stock in the basement is lost,"" lamented Luciano, a worker at a shop along St. Mark's Square. He said he remembered well the infamous ""acqua alta"" of 1966, when the water rose to a level of 1.94 metres, the highest since records began in 1923. ""These so frequent high waters have never happened before... this time there's so much more damage than in the past,"" he said. Hotels reported cancelled reservations, some as far ahead as December, following the widespread diffusion of images of Venice underwater. Tuesday's high waters submerged around 80 percent of the city, officials said.

A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays. The speaker of Italy's Senate, Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati, visited Venice on Saturday and called for the MOSE project to be completed. ""Once the emergency is over, the light on Venice should not go out,"" Italian media reported. ""Venice needs attention. Now is the time to do it and if the MOSE serves as it should to avoid such disasters, then it must be finished."""""
Italy declares state of emergency in Venice after flood,15 Nov 2019 04:59AM (Updated: 15 Nov 2019 07:04PM),AFP/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/italy-declares-state-of-emergency-in-venice-after-flood-12095702," VENICE: Italy on Thursday (Nov 14) declared a state of emergency for Venice after an exceptional tide surged through churches, shops and homes, causing millions of euros worth of damage to the UNESCO city. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the Cabinet had approved the state of emergency and ordered the immediate release of €20 million (US$22 million) in funds for the most urgent interventions"" in the devastated city after Tuesday's flooding. Despite the emergency, tourists larked around in the flooded St Mark's Square in the sunshine, snapping selfies in their neon plastic boots and taking advantage of a respite in bad weather which has driven the high tides.  Sirens warning of fresh flooding rang through the canal city early on Thursday but the water level remained low compared to Tuesday's tide, the highest in 50 years. Conte, who has called the flooding ""a blow to the heart of our country"", met Venice's mayor and emergency services before jumping in a speed boat to visit businesses and locals affected by the tide. Residents whose houses had been hit would immediately get up to €5,000 in government aid, while restaurant and shop owners could receive up to €20,000 and apply for more later, he said. Several museums remained closed to the public on Thursday. As authorities assessed the extent of the damage to Venice's cultural treasures, such as St Mark's Basilica where water invaded the crypt, locals were defiant. Many stopped for their habitual coffees at flooded bars, drinking their espresso while standing in several inches of water.   Austrian tourist Cornelia Litschauer, 28, said she felt mixed emotions seeing Venice's famous square half submerged. ""For the tourists it's amazing, it's something to see. But for the people who live here it's a real problem,"" Litschauer said, cradling her white Chihuahua Pablo. ""It's strange. Tourists are taking pictures but the city is suffering."" 'NEED TO ADAPT' The Locanda Al Leon hotel said its bookings had suffered from the international media coverage of the flood, with some guests cancelling their rooms after seeing images of Venice underwater. Under the arches of the Ducal Palace, a couple from Hong Kong posed for photos in the chilly morning sun. ""This (trip) was planned a long time ago so we couldn't change it,"" groom Jay Wong, 34, said. ""Actually this is a good experience. It's an adventure."" Tuesday's ""acqua alta,"" or high waters, submerged around 80 per cent of the city, officials said. Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 metres in 1966. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi arrived for a private tour of the damage sustained to the basilica, while rival leader of the Italian right Matteo Salvini was due to drop by for the same on Friday. French tourist Manon Gaudre, 22, said seeing Venice submerged was a ""unique experience"". ""The damage it's causing to monuments and the people is worrying,"" she said, wondering if climate change was to blame. Many, including Venice's mayor, have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that Italy - a country prone to natural disasters - must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons. ""We need to be resilient and adapt. We need a policy that looks at the climate through completely different eyes,"" Environment Minister Sergio Costa said on Thursday. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has estimated the damage to Venice at hundreds of millions of euros. The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to a mere 50,000 residents but receives 36 million global visitors each year. A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays. ""This engineering solution that will end up costing nearly six billion euros has got to work,"" Transport Minister Paola De Micheli said. The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice's lagoon during high tides - but a recent attempt to test part of it caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered it had rusted."""
"Flood, fire and plague: Climate change blamed for disasters",14 Nov 2019 04:06PM (Updated: 14 Nov 2019 04:21PM),Reuters/zl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-blamed-disasters-venice-flood-fire-plague-12093532," VENICE: Extreme floods in Venice, fires in Australia and even cases of plague in China have been attributed to climate change this week, while researchers have warned that global warming could saddle future generations with life-long illness. Venice declared a state of emergency on Wednesday (Nov 13) after apocalyptic"" floods swept through the lagoon city, flooding its historic basilica and inundating squares and centuries-old buildings. ""This is the result of climate change,"" city mayor Luigi Brugnaro said on Twitter.   City thoroughfares were turned into raging torrents, stone balustrades were shattered, boats tossed ashore and gondolas smashed against their moorings as the lagoon tide peaked at 187cm. It was the highest since the record 194cm set in 1966, but rising water levels are becoming a regular threat to the tourist jewel. ""Venice is on its knees,"" said Brugnaro. ""The damage will run into hundreds of millions of euros."" On the other side of the world, parts of Australia have been ravaged by wild bushfires this week, with four people killed and communities forced to flee the flames. Since 2016, parts of northern and inland New South Wales, along with southern Queensland, have been in drought that the Bureau of Meteorology says is being driven, in part, by warmer sea-surface temperatures affecting rainfall patterns.   Air temperatures have also warmed over the past century, increasing the ferocity of droughts and fires. But links between climate change and extreme weather events have become a political football in Australia. The coal-industry supporting government accepts the need to cut emissions while arguing that stronger environmental action would cripple its economy. That pits the country against its Pacific island neighbours which are particularly susceptible to warmer temperatures and rising seas.   Globally, concern about effective action has surged since US President Donald Trump abandoned the international Paris Accord on climate change and took steps to dismantle environmental protections. Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are among the world's only leaders who publicly question the science of climate change, despite devastating fires in their countries - in California and the Amazon basin - that environmentalists at least partly blame on global warming. PLAGUE While the politicians argue, concern is growing about the impact on the health of a warmer world. In China, health officials have reported a rare outbreak of pneumonic plague after two cases were confirmed this week in Beijing. The two were infected in the province of Inner Mongolia, where rodent populations have expanded dramatically after persistent droughts, worsened by climate change, state media said. An area the size of the Netherlands was hit by a ""rat plague"" last summer. The wider implications for health are sobering. The Lancet medical journal published a study this week saying climate change was already harming people's health by increasing the number of extreme weather events and exacerbating air pollution.   A warmer world brings risks of food shortages, infectious diseases, floods and extreme heat. If nothing is done, the impacts could burden an entire generation with disease and illness throughout their lives, researchers said. ""Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate. Their bodies and immune systems are still developing, leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants,"" said Nick Watts, one of those who led the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change study. Health damage in early childhood is ""persistent and pervasive"", he warned, bringing lifelong consequences. ""Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, gains in wellbeing and life expectancy will be compromised, and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation,"" he told a London briefing."""
"Climate change, corruption blamed for Venice flood devastation",14 Nov 2019 11:30AM (Updated: 17 Nov 2019 11:00PM),AFP/aj,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-corruption-blamed-for-venice-flood-devastation-12092858," VENICE: Much of Venice was under water on Wednesday (Nov 14) night after the highest tide in 50 years ripped through the historic Italian city, beaching gondolas, trashing hotels and sending tourists fleeing through rapidly rising waters. The government in Rome was expected to declare a state of emergency at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the flooding as a blow to the heart of our country"".   Officials blamed climate change while shopkeepers on the Grand Canal raged against those who have failed to protect the UNESCO city from the high tide. They said corruption had repeatedly delayed a barrier protection system that could have prevented the disaster.   ""The city is on its knees,"" Venice mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in an interview with national broadcaster RAI. ""There's widespread devastation,"" he said in the famed St Mark's Square, which bore the brunt of the flooding. ""In all likelihood the damage from last night runs into hundreds of millions of euros."" The state of emergency for a natural disaster will allow the government to use ""exceptional powers and means"" to intervene more quickly, and Conte said his government was ready to allocate funds. ""The disaster that has struck Venice is a blow to the heart of our country,"" Conte said at the scene. ""It hurts to see the city so damaged, its artistic heritage threatened."" St Mark's Square was calm on Wednesday evening, with just a smattering of tourists walking through the relatively dry square marked with occasional puddles.   Four Venetian friends who had gathered in the square, all wearing boots, said the relative quiet and lack of tourists was upside of an otherwise harrowing few days. ""We've never seen anything like it,"" said Alvise, 19. Earlier, tourists lugging heavy suitcases waded in thigh-high boots or barefoot through the submerged alleys, as gondola and water taxi drivers baled sewage-tainted water out of their trashed vessels. ""WE CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS"" Dirty water was swirling around the marble tombs inside the 12th-century crypt of St Mark's Basilica, which suffered untold damage when an unprecedented high tide swept through the city. It was closed to tourists as were many other Venice highlights including the Fenice Theatre and the Ducal Palace.    ""We said last year that the basilica had aged 20 years in a high tide. It risks having aged much more than that in this one,"" said the building's procurator Carlo Alberto Tesserin. A 78-year old was killed by an electric shock as the waters poured into his home. ""We ask the government to help us, the costs will be high,"" mayor Brugnaro tweeted. ""These are the effects of climate change."" ""The future of Venice is at stake,"" he warned. ""We cannot live like this anymore."" Environment Minister Sergio Costa blamed climate change and the ""tropicalisation"" of violent rainfall and strong winds. ""This is what is happening more and more often in the Mediterranean,"" Costa said on Facebook. ""Global warming will destroy our planet if we do not immediately reverse the direction.""     ""ACQUA ALTA"" The exceptionally intense ""acqua alta,"" or high waters, peaked at 1.87m. Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. ""It was unbelievable. The water rose so quickly,"" said resident Tiziano Collarin, 59, as he surveyed the damage. ""Windows were blown out, there are those who have lost everything,"" he said as the flood alarm rang out to warn those in the canal city that the tide, which had receded somewhat overnight, was rising once again. The fire brigade said it had carried out over 400 operations as well as laying on extra boats as water ambulances. Around 160 firefighters were deployed to rescue people stranded on jetties and to recover boats broken free from their moorings.   President of the Veneto region Luca Zaia said 80 per cent of the city had been submerged, causing ""unimaginable damage"" to the city, which has 50,000 residents but receives 36 million visitors each year. A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been underway since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays. The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice's lagoon during high tides - but a recent attempt to test part of the barrier caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered parts had rusted. Outside historic Venice, the Lido and Pellestrina islands were also hard hit by flooding."""
Climate change exposes future generations to life-long health harm,14 Nov 2019 07:41AM (Updated: 14 Nov 2019 08:47AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-exposes-future-generations-to-life-long-health-harm-12092508," LONDON: A child born today faces multiple and life-long health harms from climate change: growing up in a warmer world with risks of food shortages, infectious diseases, floods and extreme heat, a major global study has found. Climate change is already harming people's health by increasing the number of extreme weather events and exacerbating air pollution, according to the study published in The Lancet medical journal. And if nothing is done to mitigate it, its impacts could burden an entire generation with disease and illness throughout their lives. Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate.

""Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, gains in wellbeing and life expectancy will be compromised, and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation,"" he told a London briefing. Yet introducing policies to limit emissions and cap global warming would see a different outcome, the research teams said. In that scenario, a child born today, would see an end to coal use in Britain, for example, by their 6th birthday, and the world reaching net-zero emissions by the time they were 31.   VULNERABLE The Lancet study is a collaboration by 120 experts from 35 institutions including the World Health Organization, the World Bank, University College London and China's Tsinghua University. On a ""business-as-usual"" pathway, with little action to limit climate change, it found that amid rising temperatures and extreme weather events, children would be vulnerable to malnutrition and rising food prices, and the most likely to suffer from warmer waters and climates accelerating the spread of infectious diseases such as dengue fever and cholera. Among the most immediate and long-lasting health threats from climate change is air pollution, the researchers said. They called for urgent action to reduce outdoor and indoor pollution through the introduction of cleaner fuels and vehicles, and policies to encourage safe and active transport such as walking and cycling. The WHO says that globally in 2016, 7 million deaths were due to the effects of household and ambient air pollution. The vast majority of these were in low and middle-income countries. ""If we want to protect our children, we need to make sure the air they breathe isn't toxic,"" said Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, a global health specialist at Britain's Sussex University who worked on the Lancet study."""
"Oil is our gold and we aim to use all of it, ADNOC official says",13 Nov 2019 11:56PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/oil-is-our-gold-and-we-aim-to-use-all-of-it--adnoc-official-says-12091464," ABU DHABI: Abu Dhabi National Oil Co aims to exhaust its vast oil and gas reserves even as many consumers switch to cleaner sources of energy, a senior executive in the Gulf oil company said. The world's transition away from fossil fuel in an effort to slash greenhouse gas emissions is expected to accelerate in coming decades, leaving many oil companies and producing nations pondering their long-term future. But for state-run ADNOC, the main oil-producing company in the United Arab Emirates, which supplies nearly 3per cent of global oil demand, crude is set to remain the revenue backbone, ADNOC's upstream executive director Abdulmunim al-Kindy told Reuters. Our oil is our gold,"" al-Kindy said in an interview during the ADIPEC oil and gas conference in Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE. ""With the reserves we have, the challenge we have is monetizing it at the right time."" To achieve that, ADNOC has undergone a drive to slash extraction costs to rival other major producers including OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iraq. ADNOC has embarked on a broader transformation strategy since 2016, expanding its oil and gas business, listing one of its subsidiaries and overhauling its trading operations. This week it announced it was listing its flagship Murban crude grade and has partnered with Intercontinental Exchange Inc and oil majors including BP, Total and Shell in a new exchange to be launched in 2020. ""We are really the lowest-cost producers because of the efficiencies we drive,"" al-Kindy said. ADNOC is also seeking to diversify the sources of energy it can offer. The company is in the midst of a vast expansion of its production of natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel whose demand is forecast to rise sharply in the coming decades as Asian economies consume more power. It has signed deals with oil majors to boost its gas output and has said it was seeking investment opportunities abroad in liquefied natural gas (LNG). ""Whatever resources we have, we are going to really drive the monetization of these resources. We are not going to leave anything in the ground if we can,"" he said. ""That's the bottom line. Be it gas, conventional or unconventional, oil, conventional or unconventional, it is going to come to the market and that's our aim."" ADNOC aims to reach 1 billion cubic feet per day of unconventional gas production before 2030. The UAE wants to achieve gas self-sufficiency and possibly become a net gas exporter. A growing number of climate activists and investors have warned that to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, many of the world's oil and gas resources cannot be tapped.

"Fed sees climate change shaping economy, policy",09 Nov 2019 05:11AM (Updated: 09 Nov 2019 05:11AM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/fed-sees-climate-change-shaping-economy--policy-12078102," SAN FRANCISCO: The US central bank signalled on Friday (Nov 8) it may be getting ready to join international peers in incorporating climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability, and may even take it into account when setting monetary policy. To fulfill our core responsibilities, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to study the implications of climate change for the economy and the financial system and to adapt our work accordingly,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in remarks released at the start of the Fed's first-ever conference on climate change and economics. The Fed, she said, will need to look at how to keep banks and the financial system resilient amid risks from extreme weather, higher temperatures, rising sea levels and other effects of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And increasingly, she said, ""it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability."" Brainard's comments mark a shift for the Fed, which lags other major central banks that have made climate change an explicit part of their financial stability remits. Her talk, the first she's given in her five-year tenure at the Fed that even mentions the subject, suggests she and her colleagues are taking the risks and costs of global warming seriously. The US central bank's attention to global warming comes even as President Donald Trump's administration denies it exists. Trump on Monday notified the United Nations that the United States will in 12 months leave the Paris Climate Accord, under which 195 nations agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to prevent catastrophic planetary warming. Scientists are in broad agreement that carbon dioxide from cars, power plants and other human sources are behind the climate change that's already making powerful hurricanes, severe drought, and other weather extremes more frequent. RISING RISKS, SLOWING ECONOMIES The San Francisco Fed's conference, so oversubscribed that a webcast has been created to meet demand, gave policymakers a crash course in research that could change how the Fed forecasts economic growth, regulates banks, and even sets interest rates. Papers presented at the conference showed how climate change has crimped growth and presented ideas on how policy, including monetary policy, can be used to mitigate harm. University of Southern California professor Hashem Pesaran showed that rising average temperatures and volatile precipitation - both effects of climate change - have already slowed US economic output in recent decades. Meeting Paris Accord goals, the paper found, could limit losses to per capita US GDP from planetary warming over the next 80 years to 3 per cent or less, versus 14 per cent if goals are not met. Swedish central bank economist Conny Olovsson used an economic model to show losses to economic growth from imposing a carbon tax - an objection often raised by politicians and industry - would be dwarfed by the economic losses projected if carbon dioxide remains largely untaxed and global warming continues unchecked. In a third paper, Nicholas Muller, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, outlined how the Fed might factor environmental circumstances into monetary policy by, for example, keeping rates lower when pollution levels were increasing, to encourage consumption before they got worse, and higher when pollution was declining, to depress spending until the environment improved. Fed policymakers appeared receptive to the ideas. ""Climate change is an issue we can't afford to ignore,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at the start of the conference, a day that also marked the one-year anniversary of a fire 150 miles north of San Francisco that killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes, a conflagration blamed in part on climate change. ""This is not a hypothetical risk of the future ...the risks are here, we have to deal with them."""""

While the government did not specify how its targets would be met or enforced, the campaign will use traditional Communist Party mobilisation methods to change individual behaviour rather than cracking down on companies as in the past. By 2022, more than 60 per cent of households would be expected to engage in ""green living"" activities such as tree-planting, wildlife protection, and cutting plastic waste. Communist Party and government departments would have to meet requirements to recycle, purchase new-energy vehicles and create paperless offices, while schools would be expected to create ""green campuses"". Urban residential districts would be expected to create ""liveable environments"" and increase green spaces, while shopping malls would be encouraged to cut waste and promote ""green consumption"". China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. It has been waging war on pollution and modernising its heavy industrial economy in a bid to cut emissions and clean up its environment. As well as launching a series of campaigns against corporate polluters, it has built infrastructure and created incentives to treat waste.

"China's Yangtze region facing severe drought, affecting production: Report",07 Nov 2019 09:18AM (Updated: 07 Nov 2019 09:20AM),Reuters/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-yangtze-region-severe-drought-12071302," SHANGHAI: The middle and lower reaches of China's Yangtze river are suffering from the most severe drought in 40 years, with temperatures up to 3°C higher than normal in some regions, the official People's Daily said on Thursday (Nov 7). Citing the ministry in charge of handling natural disasters, the newspaper said the drought was affecting local grain production, and had delayed rapeseed planting in the region. The total arable land affected by drought in the Yangtze's middle and lower reaches was 154 per cent higher than last year, the ministry said. It did not give the total area. The Ministry of Emergency Management said temperatures were 1 to 3°C higher than usual in the central provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui and in parts of Fujian on the southeastern coast. China has suffered several bouts of extreme weather this year. Government forecasters have attributed record high summer temperatures and rainfall throughout China to global warming. The Ministry of Natural Resources also said in September that coastal sea levels were some 48mm higher than the 1993-2011 average in 2018, with winter ice volumes significantly smaller and temperatures higher than normal."
Scientists urge stronger Paris Agreement pledges to curb climate change,06 Nov 2019 03:03AM,Reuters/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/scientists-urge-stronger-paris-agreement-pledges-to-curb-climate-change-12066656," WASHINGTON: The vast majority of national commitments in the 2015 Paris Agreement are inadequate to prevent the worst effects of global warming, scientists said on Tuesday (Nov 5), naming the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries as among those that must ratchet up their efforts. Governments are moving in the right direction, but nowhere near enough, so hopefully they will be willing to take on much stronger commitments"" in next month's United Nation's climate summit in Spain, said Robert Watson, lead author of the report by the nonprofit Universal Ecological Fund. The report ranked nearly 75 per cent, or 136, of the pledges as insufficient, including ones by major carbon emitters China, the United States, and India. A dozen, by countries including Australia, Japan and Brazil, were judged only partially sufficient. Countries at next month's summit in Madrid will hash out some details of the international pact to curb warming. Chile withdrew as host following weeks of riots protesting inequality. Of the 184 pledges countries made under the climate agreement, only 36 are ambitious enough to help reach the agreement's goal of keeping global warming less than 1.5 Celsius (2.7 F) above pre-industrial levels, the report said. Most of those 36 are by countries in the European Union. Watson, a former chair of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the report could be read two ways: ""You can read 'My God it's hopeless', or 'My God this is a wake up call.'"" Watson estimated that even if all nations meet their existing pledges, the world would be headed for temperature rise of between 3 and 3.5 degrees Celsius, which could lead to more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The report rated the European Union's 28 member states as having sufficient pledges because they aim to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 40 per cent below the 1990 level by 2030. It ranked the United States as insufficient because President Donald Trump reversed former President Barack Obama's climate policies and yanked Washington out of the pact. The administration, which argues that Paris Agreement would cost US taxpayers too much money, filed official paperwork on Monday to withdraw. China, the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases, and India, also came in as insufficient because their pledges focus on carbon intensity targets, which lower emissions per unit of gross domestic product, or GDP. Because those economies are growing and coal produces much of their electricity, total emissions have risen sharply even though carbon intensity levels in China and India have fallen."""
Macron says Europe-China climate cooperation 'decisive',,Reuters/mi,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/paris-agreement-europe-china-macron-xi-jinping-12063758," SHANGHAI: Cooperation between Europe and China on reducing climate-warming emissions will be decisive"", French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, after the Trump administration filed paperwork to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. The US move is the first formal step in a one-year process to exit the global pact to fight climate change, part of a broader strategy by Trump to reduce red tape on American industry. But it comes at a time scientists and many world governments are urging rapid action to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. China and France pledged at this year's G20 summit to ""update"" their contributions against climate change beyond their current ones to reflect ""their highest possible ambition"". The 2015 Paris climate agreement encourages countries to make stronger pledges if they are able to do so. Speaking in Shanghai at a major trade fair, just after a keynote address by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Macron said commitments will need to be enhanced. ""If we want to be in compliance with the Paris agreement, we will need next year to enhance our commitments to reduce emissions, and we must confirm new commitments for 2030 and 2050,"" he said. ""The cooperation between China and the European Union in this respect is decisive,"" Macron added. ""Next year, we need, in the agenda of enhancement, to be collectively up to the task."" Speaking to reporters earlier, a French presidential office official expressed regret at the US move and said Macron and Xi will reaffirm their commitment to the Paris agreement. ""We regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. ""The text that will be signed tomorrow includes a paragraph on the irreversibility of the Paris agreement."" Macron and Xi are due to hold a formal meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. China aims to bring emissions to a peak by ""around 2030"" and raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy mix to 20per cent by the end of the next decade, up from 15 per cent in 2020. The United States is the first country to say it will withdraw from the deal, but 10 other countries have failed to ratify it, including Turkey, Iran and Iraq."""
Dismay as US formally starts pullout from Paris climate accord,05 Nov 2019 04:58AM (Updated: 05 Nov 2019 07:04PM),AFP/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/dismay-as-us-formally-starts-pullout-from-paris-climate-accord-12063484," WASHINGTON: The United States has formally notified the United Nations that it is withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, triggering expressions of concern and regret from other major powers on Tuesday (Nov 5). President Donald Trump went ahead with the pullout despite mounting evidence of the reality and impact of climate change, with September the fourth month in a row with near- or record-breaking temperatures. Washington presented its withdrawal letter to the UN on the first possible date under the accord negotiated by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, making the world's largest economy the sole outlier from the agreement. The US will be officially out on Nov 4, 2020, one day after the presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second term on appeals to the white working class. Announcing the move, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Trump's rationale in 2017 that the accord would disadvantage US businesses. It was America that would suffer the straitjacket,"" Pompeo told the Fox Business network. ""It would be quintessentially unfair to the American people and to the American workers."" Pompeo said in a statement that the United States would advocate a ""realistic and pragmatic model"" that included renewable energy but preserved a role for fossil fuels. French President Emmanuel Macron, who unsuccessfully tried to persuade Trump to stay in the accord named for his nation's capital, lamented the decision. ""We regret this and it makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on climate and biodiversity even more necessary,"" the French presidency said as Macron visited China, the world's largest emitter of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change. Beijing also expressed ""regret"" over Washington's decision ahead of the planned signing Wednesday of a joint document on climate by President Xi Jinping and Macron. ""We hope the US can take more responsibility, and do more to contribute a driving force to the multilateral cooperation process, instead of adding negative energy,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. Russia warned that the US withdrawal seriously undermined the Paris accord. ""Without the largest economy in the world, it's very, very hard to talk about any kind of climate agreement,"" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The United States, the number-two emitter, is still planning to attend this month's COP climate negotiations in Spain, according to a State Department official. TRUMP ROLLS BACK ACTION Pompeo in his statement pointed to a 13 per cent US reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2017 even as the economy grew. But Trump, who took office in 2017, has pledged to turn back environmental regulations as states such as California and New York try to take stronger action on their own. Trump has sought to block California from setting tighter standards on car emissions and moved to let states set their own standards on existing coal-fired power plants. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the Trump administration has ""once again thumbed its nose at our allies, turned a blind eye to the facts and further politicized the world's greatest environmental challenge."" Former vice president-turned-climate champion Al Gore deplored Trump's decision -- but said that a new president could re-enter the Paris accord within 30 days. ""No one person or party can stop our momentum to solve the climate crisis, but those who try will be remembered for their complacency, complicity and mendacity in attempting to sacrifice the planet for their greed,"" Gore said. The Paris accord set a goal of limiting temperature rises to well within two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, a goal that scientists say is vital to check the worst damage from global warming such as increasing droughts, rising floods and intensifying storms. LIMITED DIPLOMATIC EFFECT Contrary to some predictions, Trump's decision did not trigger a domino effect of withdrawals by countries such as Brazil and Australia. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an ideological ally of Trump, has belittled environmentalists but has held off on threats to withdraw from the Paris accord, with the European Union requiring adherence as a condition for a major trade deal. Trump has cast the climate accord as elitist, saying that he was ""elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."" But a Washington Post poll last month found that even in his own party he faces growing opposition on the issue, with 60 per cent of Republicans agreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by human activity."""
Algae blooms to make glaciers melt faster than thought: Scientists,,Reuters/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/algae-blooms-to-make-glaciers-melt-faster-than-thought-12052588," GENEVA: Glaciers will melt faster than current models on climate change account for as algae blooms colonise them and reduce their ability to reflect the sun's heat, scientists studying glaciers said. Glacial darkening"" is where deep purple, bulbous algae sprout on a layer of naturally occurring dust mixed with soot from air pollution and forest fires. Their presence has been confirmed for decades but as temperatures rise, more algae are thriving on the ice surface, staining glaciers the world over. Scientists differ on how much additional melting this will cause but four scientists who are studying glaciers told Reuters it would exceed what was accounted for in current projections, including those in a landmark UN report released in September. ""Glaciers have algae growths often feeding on carbon deposits so that is further darkening the ice,"" said John Pomeroy, a professor at Canada's University of Saskatchewan, on the sidelines of a ""High Mountain Summit"" in Geneva this week. ""These are not currently considered in our models for glacier melt and almost certainly will accelerate it further than our estimates currently show."" Policy-makers and experts are convening at the UN's World Meteorological Organization this week to discuss how to mitigate risks such as flash floods and droughts in mountain areas caused by global warming. A study released last month by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that glaciers in polar and high mountain regions will likely lose ""substantial mass"" by the end of the century, ultimately raising sea levels. The host of the meeting, Switzerland, has already lost 500 glaciers since the start of the last century and it could lose 90 per cent of the remaining 4,000 if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2100, Home Affairs Minister Alain Berset told participants. That is without accounting for glacial darkening. ""If you darken the ice then it melts faster. These are new insights,"" said Konrad Steffen, director of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. He said he expected this to increase melting by ""up to 10 per cent"" versus current Swiss estimates, a percentage he said was conservative. Preliminary results from an EU-backed ""DEEP PURPLE"" research project in Greenland showed much higher rates, the project's microbiologist Alexandre Anesio said. In western Canada, wildfires linked to climate change are leaving ashy deposits on glaciers, creating habitats for algae and accelerating the warming process in a feedback loop. ""What our data shows is that the deposition of soot on the glacier from wildfires, and the associated algae bloom, is causing the ice melt to increase,"" Caroline Aubry-Wake, a PhD candidate in Mountain Hydrology, told Reuters. Various research papers are underway on the accelerating effect linked to algae bloom, including studies conducted by Anesio and Aubry-Wake."""
"Carbon emissions from tropical forest loss underestimated, scientists say",,Reuters/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/carbon-emissions-tropical-forest-loss-underestimated-scientists-12051814," KUALA LUMPUR: The amount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world's lost tropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to take into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction, researchers said. A new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of forests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013, adding up to 49 million hectares, roughly the size of Spain. The carbon released from losses to those intact forests"" will amount to more than six times previous estimates when additional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050 are included, it found. Intact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no signs of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging. ""Once you've caused the initial round of damage, you have committed to a lot of further emissions in the future once the forest has opened up,"" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). ""It's a bit like if you're injured at work you have lost earnings for years into the future,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the biggest part of the picture for these intact forests."" Trees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon, the main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth's climate. But they release it when they are cut down and are burned or rot. Environmentalists say protecting existing forests and restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change and protects biodiversity. The tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001, according to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch. Of greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6 million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining. Areas analysed in the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and Congo basins and on Southeast Asia's islands. While previous research largely focused on stored carbon losses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took into account the knock-on and future effects. Those include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up forest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in hunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest regeneration. Over time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest edges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing activities increase and temperatures change. ""Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of damage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,"" said Evans, adding that undamaged forests also become more carbon-rich each year. These effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting used to work out how and where to target conservation incentives and provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added. In 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact tropical forests left, the study said. Ensuring their future should now be a priority, with increased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said. That should include better recognition of indigenous land rights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel extraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives forest loss, he added. ""Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,"" the study's lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with Australia's University of Queensland, said in a statement. ""There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilising the climate."""""
Commentary: What if governments and firms measure the one thing that matters most – carbon productivity?,31 Oct 2019 06:34AM (Updated: 31 Oct 2019 08:57AM),CNA/el,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/carbon-emissions-productivity-climate-change-global-warming-12042872," BRISBANE: Ask any economist any question, and you will usually get an answer that includes this word: “Productivity”. The winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics, Paul Krugman, set the standard in 1994 when he said, Productivity isn’t everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything. A country’s ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.” In the same vein, the new head of Australia’s treasury, Steven Kennedy, said: The most important long-term contribution to wage growth is labour productivity. For my money, they could say the same about “carbon productivity”, an idea that is going to matter to us more. Labour productivity is notoriously hard to measure; measuring changes in it is harder still. It is relatively easy to measure in the jobs we are doing less of these days, such as making washing machines; harder to measure in the jobs we are doing more of, such as caring for people. And it is less important than you might think. People are not a particularly finite resource. Allowable carbon emissions are. CARBON IS THE INPUT THAT MATTERS The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says net carbon emissions will have to be reduced to zero by 2050. That means we have a carbon budget; a limited amount of greenhouse gases we can emit from here on. It would make sense to use it wisely.   What I am proposing is a target for “carbon productivity” – the amount of production we achieve from each remaining unit of emissions – as a means of helping us cut overall carbon emissions. It is easy to calculate: Gross domestic product divided by net emissions. We already measure GDP, and we already measure emissions in tonnes, albeit unevenly. We are going to need huge increases in carbon productivity, much more so as a result of cutting emissions than increasing production. Things that are good for labour productivity might well be bad for carbon productivity. For example, replacing a sweeper with an air blower is good on the first count, bad on the second. MEASURING CARBON PRODUCTIVITY A target, or at least a widely published measure, could be introduced at a national level to focus government minds on what is important and what is not, and assist in allocating resources. Solar farms would become more likely to gain support than coal-fired power plants. Regulatory resources might be redirected in surprising ways. While a small number of large emitters constitutes an easy target for policymakers, if those large emitters are efficient, the government might find it has to move its focus to the larger number of small inefficient emitters. It could also help us think about how we resolve the conflict between the perceived need for economic growth and the need to substantially cut emissions. Both would be important, but the measures that achieve both would be the most important. Accounting debates about whether to carry forward international credits would be rendered meaningless.

Far more people at risk of rising seas than feared: Climate study,30 Oct 2019 05:48PM,Reuters/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/far-more-people-at-risk-of-rising-seas-than-feared-climate-study-12045180," LONDON: Climate change will put three times more people at risk of coastal flooding by 2050 than previously thought, according to a study published on Tuesday (Oct 29), with swathes of Asia and cities in North America and Europe all vulnerable to rising seas. The research by Climate Central, a US-based non-profit climate science and news organisation, underscored the scale of the upheaval projected to unfold as global warming increasingly threatens some of the world's most densely populated regions. The study found that 300 million people are now living on land that is likely to flood at least once a year on average by mid-century without adequate sea defences, even if governments manage to make sharp cuts in emissions. Earlier estimates had put that figure at about 80 million. The authors said they had used artificial intelligence to correct systematic errors in a previous dataset that had suggested many inhabited coastal zones were at higher elevations - and thus safer - than they actually are. We now understand that the threat from sea-level rise and coastal flooding is far greater than we previously thought,"" said Benjamin Strauss, chief executive of Climate Central and co-author of the three-year study. ""It's also true that the benefits from cutting climate pollution are far greater than we previously thought – this changes the whole benefit-cost equation,"" Strauss told Reuters. ASIAN CITIES UNDER SIEGE The study found that more than 70 per cent of the world's population currently living on land at risk are located in eight Asian countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. According to the coastal risk screening tool on the Climate Central website, Bangkok, Jakarta and Ho Chi Minh are under particular threat, with these Southeast Asian cities projected to fall below annual flood level by 2050.   Continued high carbon emissions, along with instability in the Antarctic, could lead to land currently occupied by roughly one-third of Bangladesh's and Vietnam's populations permanently falling below the high tide line by the end of the century. Even with deep cuts to carbon emissions, data from the study showed that Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam could face high tide lines above land now home to 19 per cent, 17 per cent and 26 per cent of their respective populations.   The threat that advancing seas will overwhelm the ability of countries to build coastal defences and force many millions of people to migrate has long been regarded as one of the most potentially destabilising impacts of the climate crisis. The risks were underlined last month when the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark report on oceans that said sea levels could rise by one metre by 2100 - ten times the rate in the 20th century - if carbon emissions keep climbing.   Even if governments manage some curbs on emissions, the new study, published in Nature Communications, said that about 237 million people spread across China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand are likely to face annual flooding by mid-century, unless they establish adequate sea defences. By 2100, if emissions continue unchecked, and ice sheets rapidly disintegrate, then land where 250 million people now live in those six countries will fall below the waterline at high tide - putting almost five times more people at risk than assessments based on previous elevation data had found. The study, which found that today's dykes, sea walls and levees already allow 110 million people to live below the high tide line, did not factor in the impact of these or possible future defences, the authors said, citing a lack of data.   Although a certain amount of sea-level rise is baked into the climate system due to a legacy of past carbon emissions, rapid cuts in greenhouse gas pollution now could steer the world away from worse coastal flooding by century's end, the study found. The authors urged governments to urgently conduct surveys to find out how feasible it might be to hold back the rising waters as well as take action to reverse carbon emissions, which hit a record high last year. ""We don't know whether today's coastal defences will be sufficient for tomorrow's sea levels,"" Strauss said. ""Every day of warning we've had for a hurricane saves lives and property. Every decade counts in preparing for sea-level rise."""""
Southeast Asia may become net fossil fuel importer in coming years: IEA,30 Oct 2019 09:45AM (Updated: 30 Oct 2019 09:50AM),Reuters/ic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/fossil-fuel-southeast-asia-importer-12046080," SINGAPORE: Southeast Asia could become a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years, raising the financial burden on governments and increasing carbon emissions in the region, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in a report. This comes despite expectations of slower growth in the region's energy demand as economies shift towards less energy-intensive manufacturing and services, and greater efficiency, the agency said in its annual Southeast Asia outlook. Southeast Asia was already a net oil importer at 4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, while strong growth in demand for natural gas has reduced the surplus of gas for export, the world's energy watchdog said. For coal, output from the region's top producer, Indonesia, remained well above 400 million tonnes of coal equivalent last year but increases in domestic demand and exports to China and India could reduce its surplus, the IEA said. These trends point to Southeast Asia becoming a net importer of fossil fuels in the next few years,"" the agency said. The region's overall surplus of supply over demand at 120 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2011 had been eroded to just above 30 mtoe in 2018, it said. Growing reliance on imports also raises concerns about energy security, the IEA said. For example, the region's overall dependence on oil imports is forecast to exceed 80 per cent in 2040, up from 65 per cent today. With no change in policy, Southeast Asia's energy demand is expected to grow by 60 per cent by 2040, accounting for 12 per cent of the rise in global energy use as its economy more than doubles, the IEA said. This was slower than the region's 80 per cent growth since 2000. Southeast Asia's growth in electricity demand, at an average of 6 per cent per year, has been among the fastest in the world, the IEA said. Still, some 45 million people there still lack access to electricity. The region is well on the way to achieving universal access to electricity by 2030, it added. Oil demand in Southeast Asia, home to nearly 10 per cent of the world's population, would surpass 9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, up from just above 6.5 million bpd now, the IEA said. ""Oil continues to dominate road transport demand, despite an increase in consumption of biofuels,"" the IEA said. ""Electrification of mobility, with the partial exception of two and three wheelers, makes only limited inroads. This pathway suggests little change in Southeast Asia from today's congested roads and poor urban air quality."" Demand for coal is also projected to rise steadily over the coming decades, largely fuelled by new coal-fired power plants, despite headwinds facing such projects that include increasing difficulty to secure competitive financing for new facilities. The IEA said the region's increasing reliance on imports of natural gas made the fuel less price-competitive though it appeared to be a good fit for the fast-growing cities and lighter industries in the region. ""In our projections, it is industrial consumers rather than power plants that are the largest source of growth in gas demand,"" the IEA added. Renewable energy is set to play a larger role, but without stronger policy frameworks the share of renewables in power generation would rise only to 30 per cent by 2040, from the current 24 per cent, the IEA said. Wind and solar energy are expected to grow rapidly, while hydropower and modern bioenergy – including biofuels, biomass, biogas and bioenergy derived from other waste products – would remain the mainstays of Southeast Asia's renewables portfolio."""
Saudi Aramco aims to begin planned IPO on November 3: sources,29 Oct 2019 02:25PM (Updated: 29 Oct 2019 08:10PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/saudi-aramco-aims-to-begin-planned-ipo-on-november-3--sources-12043414," DUBAI/RIYADH: Saudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors.

Aramco is looking to float a 1per cent to 2per cent stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market, in what would be one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of US$20 billion. Aramco, in response to queries by Reuters, said on Tuesday the oil company does not comment on rumour or speculation. The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders' choosing."" The people declined to be identified due to commercial sensitivities. The company will soon have more shareholders from institutions, the head of the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said. Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and chairman of Aramco's board of directors, was speaking at a panel at the conference in Riyadh. Aramco will start subscription for investors in its initial public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources. The oil giant plans to announce the transaction's price on Nov. 17, it added. The company will begin trading on the local stock market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported. The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago. However, his desired US$2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts, who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers’ equity value. Russia's sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is working on a consortium of investors for Aramco's IPO, its chief executive said. “There are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested in Aramco IPO,"" Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) head Kirill Dmitriev told reporters on Tuesday.

"Greater participation in green workshops, amid calls for more climate change education in schools",26 Oct 2019 06:02AM (Updated: 27 Oct 2019 06:50PM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/climate-change-lessons-singapore-schools-12034894," SINGAPORE: At Elias Park Primary School (EPPS), primary three students were rewarded for finishing their food this year. Those who managed to finish everything they ordered received one sticker per day, and were rewarded with a certificate upon receiving 10 stickers. While some parents might see this as a way to train fussy eaters, the real aim of the programme at EPPS, held in collaboration with Zero Waste SG, was to encourage students to only order food they can finish and educate them about consuming only what they need and reducing food waste. The school, which has implemented a compost-making and food waste reduction project since 2012, also has four electric biodigester machines and three manual compost bins. Canteen stall owners dispose of fruit peel and mainly plant-based waste into the biodigesters, which can convert the material into usable fertiliser within 24 hours. According to Mdm Chua Pei Pei, principal of EPPS, about 5kg of food scraps are converted to about 1kg of fertiliser each day. The fertiliser is then used in the gardens on the school compound, and the machines are also used to teach students about composting and food waste. Food waste is one of the three major trash streams targeted under the Ministry for Environment and Water Resources' Zero Waste Masterplan launched earlier this year. Mdm Chua said: “From regular interactions and through surveys, students believe that their efforts can make an impact as they felt that everyone has a part to play in keeping Singapore Clean and Green. They would like Singapore to be a cleaner and greener city. “For example, they would like to see more people using recyclable bags instead of plastic bags. With the increase in food deliveries, some would like to see less use of single-use disposable plastic wares and more people using containers to store take-way food.” Following calls to strengthen climate change education in schools, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in a statement in response to CNA queries that by embedding climate change issues in the school curriculum and activities, it hopes to equip students with “a fundamental scientific understanding of the issue”, enabling them to engage in constructive discussions and “make informed decisions about their actions”. Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Oct 23) that he had received several postcards from participants of the Singapore Climate Rally last month, hoping that MOE schools could help combat climate change by raising awareness of environmental issues among students. One proposed to incorporate climate studies into the national curriculum, he wrote.  He noted that the national curriculum “ensures mass awareness of and participation in environment protection”. “This is in fact one of the reasons we now have a generation of environmentally conscious young Singaporeans,” he wrote. Mr Ong said he would “recommend against” having a specific subject for climate change, or to have exams in the subject. “It is far more meaningful to embed these lessons into existing school subjects and activities, and inculcate in students good habits, such as reducing the use of air-con or devices, minimising wastage, saving water, to do our part for the environment,” he wrote. According to Ms Beatrice Chong, divisional director of curriculum planning & development 2 at MOE, students at the primary level acquire a basic understanding of global warming and environmental issues such as pollution and deforestation during Science lessons and learn the importance of using resources responsibly during Social Studies lessons. At the secondary level, students learn about carbon cycles, greenhouse gases and their contribution to global warming during Science lessons, as well as the effects of climate change during Geography lessons, she said. And at the JC level, students learn about how we influence climate change and the need for urgent action to mitigate its effects in Geography, Physics, Chemistry and Biology lessons, she explained. They also engage in discussions about climate change and its impact on communities during General Paper lessons. Environmental groups CNA spoke to all said they have seen more schools reaching out to express an interest in holding workshops for their students. Ms Pek Hai Lin, manager of Zero Waste SG, said the organisation has conducted talks and workshops in at least 30 primary and secondary schools since late 2017. “More schools seem to be taking more steps to engage students and actively removing single-use plastics in the canteen, for instance, or taking on food waste digesters, besides reducing carbon footprint in other ways,” she said. Stressing that the young need to be taught about climate change, she added that while there are currently more than enough content engagement opportunities in school, translating knowledge to daily actions can be improved. “Besides getting students to realise that Reduction is the most important of the 3Rs, there is also a need to explicitly teach students, as well as empower teachers with the knowledge of how to recycle, and to actively practice that in school every day,” she said. Adding that sustainability should be part of daily school activities, and not just standalone projects and events, she added: “When teaching students to be considerate towards fellow human beings during moral education lessons, we need to also include the environmental aspect. “When habits are formed, and societal infrastructure adequately supports that, it will transform the way we behave and treat resources. We do not need to do more, we just need to do it right.” An Edible Garden City spokesman shared that the organisation has worked with 40 schools this year to educate about 2200 students about urban farming in Singapore, food resilience and basic farming skills. It worked with 30 schools, or about 1000 students, last year.  “All our education programmes are customised according to learning objectives, and we have found that more and more schools are requesting for our educators to incorporate food resilience and food sustainability messages, and environment-related lessons into our programmes,” said the spokesman. “This is on top of common requests like encouraging innovation, or linking urban farming and biodiversity to subjects like science and geography.” The spokesman pointed out that around the world, young people have been “the catalyst for change” on key issues like climate change and gun control. “Education surrounding values like a love for nature and conscious consumption from a young age is important, as these young people will carry these good habits on to adulthood,” said the spokesman. Founder of Plastic Lite SG Aarti Giri told CNA that the organisation has seen an increase in the number of invitations from schools to conduct workshops from mid-2018. They have worked with about 40 schools so far, including kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and junior colleges. While there seems to be an increased awareness about climate change among the young, Ms Giri said there are “multiple gaps that need to be filled”. “Much of the advocacy reaching them seems to be theory based,” she said. “They see their peers and family members leading a high consumption and consequently a high waste output life. Simply put, many do not see the advocates of climate change walking the talk.” Ms Giri stressed that climate change education should equip the young with the right mindset and in-depth education “so that they are driven to arrive at targeted solutions”. Adding that zero waste schools are “achievable”, she said they would also allow students to explore creative and innovative ideas that may even pave the way for implementation on a national level. Schools like National Junior College (NJC) are paving the way for their students to get involved in climate change research earlier. According to vice-principal Harman Johll, there are 177 research projects in total across the secondary 3 and JC 1 levels, and about 20 to 25 per cent of all the projects are climate change-related. These include projects on battery and solar technology and agritech. Research is a compulsory subject in the secondary two and three syllabus. Students are granted autonomy on what subjects they would like to study and can pursue further projects after secondary three with school teachers or other institutes of higher learning, said Mr Johll. He added that the school has seen more climate change-related projects in recent years. In 2019, the college also established a new Agri-Tech Research Facility in partnership with the Singapore Food Agency and start-up, Life3 Biotech. The facility promotes collaboration between schools and research institutes in urban agriculture and new technologies, and explores opportunities to boost Singapore’s food security and strengthen its resilience to the effects of climate change. Students from other schools can also join projects within the facility, said Mr Johll. Mr Johll also noted that the environment club co-curricular activity group has positively influenced the student body, adding that they are “being the change they want to see”. “You can see students and even teachers being more conscious of how they use water and make sure that we turn off the utilities when they’re not needed, and so on. They do send a very strong signal when it comes to recycling, e-waste and so on,” he said. “One (of the members) scolded me the other day and told me to stop using plastic straws. They have quite a strong influence across the student population when it comes to taking care of the environment.”"
Teen climate activist Thunberg leads climate rally in Vancouver,26 Oct 2019 12:47AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/teen-climate-activist-thunberg-leads-climate-rally-in-vancouver-12035988," VANCOUVER: Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg will address a rally in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Friday (Oct 25) in the latest leg of her global campaign to spark action to tackle rising carbon emissions. The 16-year-old Swede has been touring North America after addressing the United Nations Climate Action Summit last month, where she denounced world leaders in a passionate speech for being slow to fight global warming. This week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals won the most seats in Canadian federal election but lost the parliamentary majority. Trudeau needs support from other parties to govern, most likely the left-leaning New Democrats, who want aggressive cuts in carbon emissions cuts and greater urgency in fighting climate change. With this being our first strike post election, we need numbers to show our government that we are unstoppable and a better world is possible!"" organisers Sustainabiliteens Vancouver wrote on their Facebook page. The NDP are also opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which would nearly triple the flow of crude from Alberta's oil sands to the Port of Vancouver for export to refineries abroad. Trudeau's government bought the pipeline in 2018 for CUS$4.5 billion to help it get built but the project in fiercely opposed by environmental and indigenous activists and has been delayed by repeated court challenges. ""Climate leaders do not build or invest in pipelines that not only stand to have devastating environmental repercussions but undermine Indigenous title and rights, Trudeau has taken a contrary path,"" said Kukpi7 Judy Wilson, Secretary-Treasurer of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, which will be marching alongside Thunberg. Protesters will assemble in downtown Vancouver in the morning for a hour-long march through the city centre followed by a rally. The protest will kick off with a news conference announcing legal action by fifteen young Canadians who are suing the federal government for violating their rights by knowingly contributing to climate change. Last week Thunberg addressed a rally in Edmonton, Alberta, the heart of Canada's energy industry, where she was met by a smaller counter-protest of oil and gas workers. Canada is the world's fourth largest oil and gas producer and Trudeau's Liberal government is trying to find a balance between taking steps to cut carbon emissions while also growing the country's energy industry, which contributes 11per cent of national gross domestic product."""
Residents fear Jakarta’s sinking problem will be sidelined with Indonesia’s capital move,,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-jakarta-sinking-capital-move-neglect-coastal-flooding-12034874," JAKARTA: The last time people prayed at the Waladuna mosque in the Muara Baru neighbourhood of North Jakarta, seawater had flooded the veranda during high tide, drowning the footpaths leading to the mosque in knee-deep water. That was 18 years ago, residents told CNA. Not long after, people stopped praying at the mosque, built in the 1980s when the whole area was still sitting well above sea level. Over the years, the ground beneath the mosque, as did the rest of Muara Baru, sank further and further. Local residents said the massive flood which hit Jakarta in 2007, caused by a combination of persistent heavy rainfall and surging tide water, compelled the government to erect a wall to save the neighbourhood. The mosque was deemed unsalvageable, and so the dike was built around it, standing 6m from sea level.   Today, the Waladuna mosque, which has become the unofficial symbol of Jakarta’s chronic land subsidence problem, stands lopsided and half-submerged in 1m-deep water during the day. A colony of moss and mussels covered the mosque’s walls, running all the way to its dilapidated roof, providing a hint of where the sea level reaches when tide is at its highest. Behind the dike, warehouses and factories had begun packing up and leave, leaving an empty plot of land sitting 3m below sea level. The seawater constantly seeped through the cracks on the dike, local resident Mr Asmadi Widianto told CNA, drenching the neighbourhood and turning the ground into mud and swamp. “That’s why the factories and warehouses moved. Trucks would get stuck in the mud and if the area is flooded during the rainy season, the contents of the warehouses would be destroyed,” he said. The warehouses still standing now are largely empty, and the 37-year-old predicted that it would not be long before they are bulldozed to the ground.   Jakarta is one of the fastest sinking megacities in the world due to excessive groundwater extraction for drinking and other everyday purposes by the city’s 10 million inhabitants. Sixty per cent of Jakarta’s water demand is met by groundwater extraction, which compacts the soil around the aquifers and causes the grounds above them to sink. Residents told CNA they are worried that the problem would be ignored with the eventual relocation of Indonesia’s capital to East Kalimantan. However, the central government assured the people that it would continue to assist Jakarta to tackle its problems, including land subsidence. RESIDENTS PLAGUED BY LAND SUBSIDENCE Muara Baru resident Mr Mr Iwan Setiawan said it could take up to six months for the water to dry completely after a flood. “The water had nowhere to go because the area is now below sea level,” the 75-year-old told CNA.   When Mr Setiawan first came to Muara Baru in 1967, the whole area was sitting 3m above sea level. The area began sinking in the 1970s, he recounted, and by the early 2000s, the neighbourhood sat at sea level. Following that, the rate of land subsidence appeared to have speeded up, he said. The average land subsidence affecting Jakarta is 1.15 cm a year, with some parts of the city sinking as much as 25cm annually, including Muara Baru. According to a model conducted by Indonesia’s Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), 95 per cent of the coastal areas in Jakarta could be entirely submerged below sea level by 2050. Muara Baru, which currently sits 2m to 3m below sea level, could sink to more than 5m below water over the next 30 years. With Jakarta facing chronic land subsidence, rising sea level from global warming, threat of massive flooding as well as crippling traffic congestion, the Indonesian government announced in August that it is moving its capital to East Kalimantan as early as 2024.   Over in the neighbourhood of Luar Batang, North Jakarta, roads and alleyways are filled with houses and shops sitting 0.5m to 1m below street level. To compensate the sinking, residents have been adding ramps and steps to access their homes, while some completely abandoned the ground floor and build new levels entirely. “We have to fix cracks in our houses every now and then because of the shifting of the grounds,” said Mdm Emmy Lestari, whose house’s ground level now sits 2m below sea level. “I built the second floor of my house about five years ago because seawater would creep in through the cracks of the dike and flood the neighbourhood. “I hope the central government will completely solve this problem before they move. Otherwise, one day I might have to build a third floor.” GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE Meanwhile, groundwater extraction continues to be a problem with no end in sight. Since 1998, the number of household served by Jakarta’s piped water distribution system only grew from 44.5 per cent to 59.4 per cent in 2018, according to data from the Jakarta government. “If Jakarta can stop extracting groundwater, the land subsidence could stop. This is because 70 per cent of land subsidence in Jakarta is caused by groundwater extraction,” Mr Peter Letitre, a groundwater management expert from Dutch-based think-tank Deltares told CNA.   The expert said Tokyo used to experience similar problem before the city stopped extracting groundwater in the 1970s. “It is true that moving ministries and government offices will alleviate some of the pressures Jakarta’s aquifers have been facing. “But the government has been weak on people who continue to extract groundwater,” he said. Currently, there is no regulation to stop anyone, from individual homeowners to massive shopping mall operators, to carry out their own groundwater extractions. “Even government offices use groundwater,” Mr Letitre said, adding that he is cautiously optimistic that the central government will continue to pay attention to the issue even as they move away from Jakarta. “All major companies are headquartered in Jakarta. Jakarta will continue to be Indonesia’s business and economic hub, so the government will have no choice but to save Jakarta from sinking.” Meanwhile, in some neighbourhoods served by piped water system, residents lamented that water supply is sometimes unreliable. Cilincing resident Mdm Nur Hidayati said she is also doubtful about the water quality. “We wouldn’t drink water from the tap. It is often white and smells like chlorine. During the rainy season, the tap water is brown or yellow because it is mixed with dirt and soil,” she told CNA. “Sometimes we only get running water during the night or sometimes very early in the morning like 2am or 3am.” WITH A NEW CAPITAL, WILL JAKARTA BE NEGLECTED? Dr Heri Andreas, a geologist at ITB who has been studying Jakarta's land subsidence for the past 20 years, worried that moving the capital would mean there would be less attention on the issue. “It’s like your wife is sick and you look for another wife. Of course the attention for the sick, old wife will be less,” he told CNA. The expert said even with the central government still in Jakarta currently, not much progress has been done to address the city’s land subsidence.   The government has been planning to build a giant 32-km seawall to protect the coastal areas, but years since the project is launched in 2014, officials could not agree on a design. “Jakarta needs 500 trillion rupiah (US$35.5 billion) for infrastructure development to mitigate floods and traffic congestion. Meanwhile the new capital would cost 466 trillion rupiah to build,” Dr Andreas said. “Is there enough political will to set aside another 200 trillion rupiah (US$14.2 billion) to build the giant seawall which would only serve as a remedy and not a solution? That remains to be seen.” Similarly, residents interviewed by CNA said they are worried about the eventual relocation of the capital, arguing that the problems facing Jakarta is too big for the local government to solve on its own. “Different governors have different commitment towards the problems Jakarta is facing. That’s why we need the central government to step in and intervene,” Muara Baru resident Mr Setiawan said. FEDERAL ATTENTION TO CONTINUE: DEPUTY MINISTER Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan has also expressed his concerns. “For us here in Jakarta, we hope the plan to move the capital comes with continued commitment to address Jakarta’s problems,” he told reporters last month. “There are problems which need collaboration with other provinces, such as finding water source to stop groundwater extractions, and the central government have been instrumental in brokering cooperation between Jakarta and the surrounding provinces. “Then there’s the issue of mitigating the effects of land subsidence which require a lot of money.” Mr Baswedan said his office is planning to issue permits and taxes for groundwater usage in areas not yet served by the piped water system. “If individual homeowners extract groundwater without a permit, they can be fined. For building management, they can have their building certificate revoked,” he said.   When contacted, Mr Rudy Prawiradinata, deputy minister on regional development at the Ministry for National Development Planning said the central government would continue to assist Jakarta to tackle its problems, including the land subsidence issue. “There are several projects which are in the pipeline. We will continue to finance them or help Jakarta to seek loans from other countries,” he said. “Moving the capital will alleviate some of the problems Jakarta is facing. Less people will mean less traffic and more access to clean water. The bottom line is, Jakarta will remain as Indonesia’s business and economic hub. It will continue to be an important part of the country,” he said."
Russia discovers five Arctic islands uncovered by melting ice,22 Oct 2019 11:13PM (Updated: 22 Oct 2019 11:22PM),AFP/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/russia-five-new-arctic-islands-melting-ice-12024706," MOSCOW: Russia's navy said Tuesday (Oct 22) it had discovered five new islands revealed by melting glaciers in the remote Arctic. An expedition in August and September charted the islands, which have yet to be named and were previously hidden under glaciers, said the head of the northern fleet, Vice Admiral Alexander Moiseyev. Mainly this is of course caused by changes to the ice situation,"" Moiseyev, who headed the expedition, said at a press conference in Moscow. ""Before these were glaciers; we thought they were (part of) the main glacier."" ""Melting, collapse and temperature changes led to these islands being uncovered."" Glacier loss in the Arctic in the period from 2015 to 2019 was more than in any other five-year period on record, a United Nations report on global warming said last month. Russia has opened a string of military and scientific bases in the Arctic in recent years, with interest in the region growing as rising temperatures open up shipping routes and make hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. This summer's expedition to two archipelagoes - Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya - involved some 60 people including civilians from the Russian Geographic Society and was the first aboard a rescue towboat instead of an icebreaker. Video of expedition members encountering an angry walrus that attacked their inflatable landing craft went viral last month. ""The two months this year when we held our expedition to Franz Josef Land can be described as warm,"" said Denis Krets, commander of the northern fleet's expedition force. ""We were very lucky because we could land on islands where not every year the shore and the inshore water is free of ice."" During the expedition, the defence ministry announced it had found five new islands in Vize Bay off Novaya Zemlya, a vast mountainous archipelago with two main islands. The islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them. It also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya. Moiseyev said names for the new islands were ""upcoming"". ""Of course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it."""""
Canada's Trudeau hangs onto power in election; aides see 2-year respite,,Agencies/zl(rw)/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/justin-trudeau-liberals-to-form-canada-minority-government-12022438," OTTAWA: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hung onto power after a tight election on Monday (Oct 21) that saw his government reduced to a minority, but aides predicted he would be able to govern for two years without many problems. Trudeau, one of the world's most prominent progressive politicians, struggled to overcome the effects of two domestic scandals. His Liberals were leading or elected in 157 seats, a decrease of 20, preliminary results showed. He now looks set to govern with the left-leaning New Democrats, who have 24 seats. Together the two parties can muster a majority 180 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than 2.5 years. Although the New Democrats lost 16 seats, leader Jagmeet Singh is now in a good position to press for action on priorities such as more social spending and increased action on climate change.   United States President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to Trudeau, calling the Liberals' win a wonderful and hard fought victory"". Congratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!  One senior Liberal also noted that many legislators needed to serve for another two years to meet the six-year requirement for a Parliamentary pension. ""That gives us a pretty free hand for that period,"" said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. The New Democrats struck deals to help keep Liberal minority governments in power from 1972-1974 and in 2005. The Canadian dollar weakened 0.2 per cent to 1.3120 per US dollar, or 76.22 US cents, as investors worried about how the minority government would manage the resource sector. Futures on the Toronto stock market were up about 0.4 per cent. Trudeau visited Montreal's subway, posing for selfies with commuters early on Tuesday, an echo of 2015 when he did the same thing. This win was different. But Trudeau barely mentioned the loss of his majority when he spoke to supporters early on Tuesday, saying he had ""a clear mandate"" for a progressive agenda and more action to combat global warming.   This is unlikely to please the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which cast out every Liberal legislator amid anger over what the energy industry sees as overly stringent environmental rules. The most prominent victim was Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, one of Trudeau's top cabinet members. Trudeau's liberal image took a blow early in the campaign when photos emerged of him wearing blackface in the early 1990s and in 2001. He had already been wrestling with the fallout from accusations he pressured former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to help shield engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc from corruption charges. In August, a top watchdog said he had breached ethics rules. Wilson-Raybould, now an independent member of parliament, retained her seat on Monday, a feat in a country where nearly all legislators are backed by major parties. Former minister Jane Philpott, who also quit cabinet over the affair and ran as an independent, lost her Ontario riding. The election was also a disappointment for Andrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservatives, who had sought a majority. Although the Conservatives won the popular vote, with nearly all votes counted on Tuesday morning they were leading or elected in 121 ridings, up only 24 seats. Scheer said he would continue to lead the party, but the result looks set to reopen questions about his future. Even before the election, some in the party were speculating about a leadership challenge if he lost."""
"EU, China, others, team up to coordinate 'green' investment financing",,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/eu--china--others--team-up-to-coordinate--green--investment-financing-12015266," WASHINGTON: The European Union, China, India and several other countries teamed up on Friday to coordinate rules and standards for trillions of dollars of private and public green"" investment needed over decades to prevent irreversible climate change. The initiative, called the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF), also involves Argentina, Chile, Canada, Kenya and Morocco - a group responsible for 44 per cent of the world's GDP and the same amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Its aim is not to raise money, but to harmonise rules on what is sustainable, or ""green"" investment, across the world so that private capital can flow into it more freely. ""To deal with climate change Europe can only do so much, because Europe generates only around 9 per cent of emissions,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Reuters on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington where the initiative was launched. ""While public funding will be vital for the transition, it cannot pay the massive bill alone. We also have to tap into private capital to raise the trillions needed,"" he said. ""No national budget can pay for that on its own. Nor should it. Countries should link their sustainable financing needs to global financial markets to scale up green investment at the level that the world needs,"" he said. The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, in June sought to boost the flow of private money to tackle climate change by publishing guidelines on what qualifies as environmentally friendly investment. But China and some others also have their own rules on that, which shows the need for a joint initiative to keep them harmonised to avoid market fragmentation, Dombrovskis said. The European Union has agreed to substantial reductions of carbon emissions by 2030 and the Commission wants the bloc to reduce them to zero by 2050 to help stop global warming, the rise of average worldwide temperatures. To cut emissions by 2030, many sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, agriculture and energy, require an extra annual investment of between €180-290 billion and even more is needed to achieve zero emissions by 2050. ""We need to have the international community on board and that is why we are launching the international platform for sustainable finance to exchange best practices, to coordinate our approach,"" Dombrovskis said. The United States, the world's biggest economy which is also second biggest in terms of CO2 emissions after China, was conspicuously absent from the initiative as President Donald Trump maintains that global warming is a ""hoax."" ""The US it is not among the founding members, but we see lots of interest from US states, from the industry, from the financial sector,"" Dombrovskis said."""
Saudi Aramco delays planned IPO until after earnings update: Sources,,Reuters/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/saudi-aramco-delays-planned-ipo-until-after-earnings-update-12010686," DUBAI/RIYADH: Saudi Aramco has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence in the world's largest oil firm, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday (Oct 17). Aramco had been expected to announce plans next week to float a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake on the kingdom's Tadawul market, in what would have been one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of US$20 billion. However, after a Sep 14 attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais plants temporarily knocked out half its crude output, the world's top exporter wants to reassure investors by first presenting results covering the period, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. They want to do all that they can to hit the valuation target. Solid results after the attack will put them in a stronger position,"" said one of the sources. The second source confirmed the offering had been postponed, and there was currently no new date set for the listing. Neither source knew when third quarter results were likely to come out. In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Saudi Aramco said: ""The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders' choosing."" The news comes after Reuters, citing sources familiar with the IPO, reported on Sep 24 that the offering was unlikely to happen this year in light of the attacks. The Financial Times, which initially reported the IPO delay on Thursday, cited a source as saying the listing was delayed by ""weeks"". The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago. However, his desired US$2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers' equity value. Then came the September attack, which initially knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, or more than 5 per cent of global oil supply. Aramco executives have insisted since the attack that it would have no impact on its plans to list the company. The full restoration of oil output as declared by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Oct 3 - at a faster clip than expected - was seen boosting the company's image. ""The official line was that the Q3 results were very good, so they want to update the analysts and market the IPO after the Q3 numbers,"" the second source said. Aramco halted plans for a blockbuster international listing of around 5per cent last year amid debate over where to list overseas, but talks resumed this summer. They were given impetus by the appointment of Yasir al-Rumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed and former investment banker, as chairman of Aramco. A host of banks were given roles to arrange the listing. Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom's crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack."""
Keep nuclear in the energy mix to tackle climate change: IEA's Birol,16 Oct 2019 08:36PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/keep-nuclear-in-the-energy-mix-to-tackle-climate-change-iea-s-12006414," PARIS: The decline of nuclear in the global energy mix poses a threat to economies and efforts to reduce carbon emissions, International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Wednesday (Oct 16). Safety concerns, soaring costs and technological setbacks have slowed nuclear projects since the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan in March 2011. At the same time, despite governments setting ambitious targets to cut green house gas emissions responsible for global warming, emissions hit a record high in 2018. This is a result of government failure,"" Birol told an electricity conference in Paris. ""There is a growing disconnect between government targets and what is happening in real life, a very dangerous disconnect,"" said the boss of the IEA, which advises industrialised countries on energy issues. ""I’m worried about the decline of nuclear in the energy mix if governments don’t change their policies,"" Birol said referring to new capacity and lifespan extensions. Birol said nuclear's contribution to Europe's energy mix could plunge to just 4 per cent within two decades from 25 per cent currently with huge consequences for both emissions and economies. At the same time, the share of polluting fossil fuels in the global energy mix remains at about 63 per cent, the same level as in the 1990s, Birol said. Renewables also pose a threat to nuclear energy as costs fall and capacity rises, according to the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report published in September. Faced with increasing protests and calls for action to tackle global warming, Birol said nuclear had a role to play in a power sector responsible for 40 per cent of overall emissions. ""Governments need to keep the existing nuclear power plants. It is the cheapest solution. It would be a big waste and a pity if we don’t keep them,"" he said. Japan went without nuclear power for almost two years following Fukushima, Germany has since pledged to exit nuclear altogether by 2022 and even France, the world's second largest nuclear user, plans to reduce its reliance. France, which depends on nuclear power for more than 75 per cent of its electricity, aims to cut that to 50 per cent by 2035 while boosting renewables. In the United States, the world's largest nuclear market, operator Tennessee Valley Authority plans to extend the lifespan of its existing nuclear fleet by 20 years and develop new nuclear capacity, CEO Jeff Lyash told the electricity conference in Paris."""

If children eat poorly, they live poorly,"" said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore, unveiling the Fund's first State of the World's Children report since 1999. ""We are losing ground in the fight for healthy diets.""   Problems that once existed at opposite ends of the wealth spectrum have today converged in poor and middle-income countries, the report showed. Despite a nearly 40 per cent drop from 1990 to 2015 of stunting in poor countries, 149 million children four or younger are today still too short for their age, a clinical condition that impairs both brain and body development. Another 50 million are afflicted by wasting - a chronic and debilitating thinness also born of poverty. At the same time, half of youngsters across the globe under five are not getting essential vitamins and minerals, a long-standing problem UNICEF has dubbed ""hidden hunger"".   Over the last three decades, however, another form of child malnutrition has surged across the developing world: Excess weight. ""This triple burden - undernutrition, a lack of crucial micronutrients, obesity - is increasingly found in the same country, sometimes in the same neighbourhood, and often in the same household,"" Victor Aguayo, head of UNICEF's nutrition programme, told AFP. ""A mother who is overweight or obese can have children who are stunted or wasted."" Across all age groups, more than 800 million people in the world are constantly hungry and another two billion are eating too much of the wrong foods, driving epidemics of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. ""HIDDEN HUNGER"" Among children under five, diet during the first 1,000 days after conception is the foundation for physical health and mental development. And yet, only two in five infants under six months are exclusively breastfed, as recommended. Sales of milk-based formula have risen worldwide by 40 per cent, and in upper middle-income countries such as Brazil, China and Turkey by nearly three-quarters.   Missing vitamins and minerals, meanwhile, can lead to compromised immune systems, poor sight and hearing defects. A lack of iron can cause anaemia and reduced IQ. ""It's 'hidden' because you don't notice the impact until it is too late,"" Brian Keeley, editor-in-chief of report, told AFP. ""You don't notice that the child is running a little slower than everyone else, struggling a bit in school."" The rise of obesity, however, is plain to see. The problem was virtually non-existent in poor countries 30 years ago, but today at least 10 per cent of under five-year-olds are overweight or obese in three-quarters of low-income nations. ""There needs to be a focus on obesity before it is too late,"" said Keeley. ""Unless you deal with it in a preventative way, you're going to struggle to fix it later on."" Cheap, readily available junk food, often marketed directly to kids, has made the problem much worse. ""Children are eating too much of what they don't need - salt, sugar and fat,"" Keeley added. Progress in fighting undernourishment will also be hampered by climate change, the report warned. TAX SUGARY DRINKS A single degree Celsius of warming since the late-19th century has amplified droughts responsible for more than 80 per cent of damage and losses in agriculture. Earth's average surface temperature is set to rise another two or three degrees by 2100.   Research by scientists at Harvard University, meanwhile, have shown that the increased concentration of CO2 in the air is sapping staple food crops of those essential nutrients and vitamins, including zinc, iron and vitamin B. ""The impacts of climate change are completely transforming the food that is available and that can be consumed,"" Aguayo said. Making sure every child has access to a healthy diet must become a ""political priority"" if widespread malnutrition is to be conquered, especially in developing countries, the report said. Taxes on sugary foods and beverages; clear, front-of-package labelling; regulating the sale of breast milk substitutes; limiting the advertising and sale of 'junk food' near schools - these and other measures could make a difference, it concluded.   ""The way we understand and respond to malnutrition needs to change,"" said Fore. ""It is not just about getting children enough to eat. It is above all about getting them to eat the right food."" The recent rise of awareness about the danger of global warming is instructive, the authors said. ""Just as we have organised a movement around climate change, we need to mobilise civil society,"" said Aguayo. ""If our children are not fed healthy diets, we are putting a huge question mark on the future of our societies."""""

Solar powered cars set off for Australia's outback race,,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/solar-powered-cars-set-off-for-australia-s-outback-race-11996256," MELBOURNE: More than 40 racing teams from 21 countries left Darwin on Sunday to race across Australia to the southern city of Adelaide in the world's fastest solar powered cars. The 3,000 kilometre (1,864 mile) Bridgestone World Solar Challenge is one of the most prestigious solar car races. The biannual event first began in 1987 and is based on a notion that a 1000 watt car would complete the trip from Darwin to Adelaide in 50 hours. The teams are expected to complete the race by Thursday, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun. In the week preceding the event, teams had to pass a series of practical safety and compliance tests to qualify for the start line. Top Dutch Solar Racing team car ‘Green Lightning’ led off the competitors from Darwin’s State Square after earning pole position with the fastest lap at Hidden Valley Raceway on Saturday . The teams, comprising of secondary and tertiary students form countries ranging from Australia through Sweden, Netherlands and Japan to the United States, must be self-sufficient, travelling each day as far as they can until 5 p.m. and making camps to stay overnight along the route through the desert. The solar vehicles are categorised to compete in three different classes: challenger, cruiser and adventure.

Climate change protesters block BBC headquarters in London,11 Oct 2019 04:01PM (Updated: 11 Oct 2019 10:18PM),Reuters/nr/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-protesters-block-bbc-headquarters-london-11991970," LONDON: Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked the BBC's headquarters on Friday, calling on Britain's public service broadcaster to treat climate change with the same gravity as World War Two and tell the public the truth. The group, which promotes a rebellion against the political, economic and social structure of the modern world to avert the worst devastation outlined by scientists studying climate, is engaged in two weeks of civil disobedience in London. Extinction Rebellion rose to prominence in April when it snarled traffic in central London for 11 days. It wants governments to take much more radical to reduce greenhouse emissions. Holding banners bearing slogans such as Planet Before Profit"", waving flags, singing and chanting, a few dozen demonstrators gathered outside of the BBC's main building calling for it take global warming more seriously. ""We're here today to demand that the BBC respond to the emergency in the way they responded to World War Two i.e. devoting the entire professional management structure to getting the message out to the British public,"" spokesman Donnachadh McCarthy told Reuters. ""We're here because the BBC has refused to declare a climate emergency. We're also here today because the BBC continues to normalise high-carbon lifestyles with programmes like Top Gear promoting flying and driving,"" he said. A BBC spokeswoman said she could not comment on security matters. She refused to comment on the criticism of BBC coverage. Some activists sat outside the BBC offices and glued their hands to doors after days of similar such action around the city. Extinction Rebellion wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse. The group has been taking action in several countries including Britain, Germany, Austria, Australia, France and New Zealand since the start of the week. Police in London have made more than 1,000 arrests. The group wants Britain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 rather than the government's 2050 target."""

German cabinet approves climate protection measures,,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/german-cabinet-approves-climate-protection-measures-11985328," BERLIN: The German cabinet on Wednesday (Oct 9) approved climate protection measures designed to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions, keeping on track plans by Chancellor Angela Merkel to pass the landmark package this year. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze took to Twitter to announce the approval of the measures, which would be enshrined in a Climate Protection Law. The approval is a relief for Merkel, whose right-left coalition has suffered regional elections losses and been riven by disputes over pension and tax reforms. The parties plan a review of their loveless marriage by the end of the year. Finally there are binding rules for climate protection - and that's a good thing. I have fought for this for a long time and I am happy that it was approved today,"" Schulze wrote on Twitter. As Merkel and her ministers met at the chancellery, hundreds of Extinction Rebellion climate activists blocked a major bridge nearby on the third day of global protests designed to press governments to take more drastic action against global warming. ""We have brought a 'plastic sea' with us to show the pollution in our oceans,"" said Clara Thompson, spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion. ""We also want to draw attention to the (United Nations) World Climate Report."" UN climate scientists warned in a report last month that if emissions of greenhouse gases are not slashed the world must face a reality of cities vanishing under rising seas, rivers running dry and marine life collapsing. Merkel, who has faced criticism that the measures were unambitious, vowed this week that the climate package would contain a mechanism to monitor compliance with emission limits set for individual sectors. The mechanism will allow ministries to monitor which sectors are meeting emissions goals and adjust targets based on their progress. Some of the mechanisms could yet be modified or toughened up in the upper chamber of parliament. The overall goal of the measures - priced at €54 billion - is to cut German greenhouse gas emissions to 55 per cent of the 1990 level by 2030. Activists and the ecologist Green party, which has a strong position in the upper chamber, have been outraged by plans to introduce a carbon dioxide price of €10 (US$10.97) a tonne for transport and heating in buildings from 2021 and gradually increase it to €35 in 2025. Economists and activists had hoped for a starting price of at least €40 and point to Switzerland where that price is about €90 for heating with fossil fuels. The government also wants to raise car and air traffic taxes as well as increase a road toll for trucks from 2023. It also wants to extend subsidies for electric cars and broaden a charging network. It also wants to revive onshore wind turbine construction after it declined due to bureaucracy and citizens' opposition. Building up renewable energy capacity is paramount given plans to phase out both nuclear and coal power plants."""
Investors get lost in Big Oil's carbon accounting maze,,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/investors-get-lost-in-big-oil-s-carbon-accounting-maze-11984588," LONDON: Wide variations in the way oil companies report their efforts to reduce carbon emissions make it difficult to assess the risk of holding their shares as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, senior fund managers say. Investors have poured money into so-called sustainable funds, which take into account companies' environmental, social, legal and other standards, and funds are under pressure from their customers and authorities to make those standards robust. Fund managers are also applying environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria more widely in traditional investments to help them judge how companies will fare over the long term. There is a growing realization that some companies' profits will shrink faster than others as governments prioritize low-carbon energy to meet the U.N.-backed Paris agreement's goal of cutting emissions to net zero"" by the end of the century. But oil and gas companies are among the biggest dividend payers, and major funds are reluctant to divest from them, arguing that by staying in they are in a better position to pressure companies to improve. ""Do investors have the data that we need? No, I don't think we have the data that we need at all,"" said Nick Stansbury, investment strategist at British insurer Legal & General's investment management unit, Britain's biggest asset manager with around US$1.3 trillion under management. ""Disclosure is not necessarily so we can seek to change the numbers, but so we can start understanding and pricing the risks,"" Stansbury said. ""A THOUSAND WAYS TO PARIS"" There are many voluntary initiatives and frameworks to unify carbon accounting and target setting; some overlap but none have been universally adopted. Further projects exist for other greenhouse gases such as methane. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is one such set of standards, established by non-governmental organizations and industrial groups in the 1990s. Companies can report their progress in line with these standards through non-profit CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, which then ranks them. Norway's Equinor comes first in its list of 24 oil major companies, but not all of them report in every year. (GRAPHIC: Big oil ranking by the CDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6698/6680/CDPper cent20oilper cent20andper cent20gasper cent20companyper cent20leagueper cent20table.jpg) There is also the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the G20's Financial Stability Board, as well as industry bodies, in-house models at oil firms and banks and third-party verifiers and consultants. ""There are a thousand ways to Paris,"" London-based BP's Chief Executive Bob Dudley said at a Chatham House event earlier this year referring to the 2015 accord aiming to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. BP Finance Chief Brian Gilvary told Reuters BP would welcome more consistency within the sector to show what oil companies are doing about emissions and that an industry body, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), was discussing carbon accounting. A plethora of third party ESG verifier companies were emerging with varying ways of measuring ESG metrics, he said, adding that some such firms would say to an oil company, ""We believe your score is this, and, by the way, if you spend US$50,000 we'll show you how you can improve that score."" UBS, with US$831 billion of invested assets, has US$2 billion in its Climate Aware passive equity strategy, which is in part based on a company's emissions reporting. In that strategy ""we tilt towards companies that are better performing on a range of climate metrics and away from companies that do not perform so well in this respect,"" Francis Condon, executive director for sustainable investing, said. ""We don't want to be accused of greenwashing or falling for it,"" he said, adding that UBS regularly encouraged companies to prepare for the climate transition. Using a broad measure, global sustainable investment reached US$30.1 trillion across the world's five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review. This equates to between a quarter and half of all assets under management, due to varying estimates of that figure. Condon said most investors were still more focused on returns than wider sustainability criteria but were becoming concerned that companies may expose them to possible future climate-related financial losses. ""There is a very limited appetite for giving up performance for higher ESG. The question is more: is management taking on risks it can't manage?"" To try to answer that question, the world's biggest financial service providers are investing in companies which provide ESG-related data. This year alone, Moody's bought Vigeo Eiris and Four Twenty Seven, MSCI bought Carbon Delta and the London Stock Exchange bought Beyond Ratings. S&P acquired Trucost in 2016. Independent climate risk advisors Engaged Tracking say they attracted two-thirds of their clients in the past year. All six companies provide data, assessments and consulting on the climate exposure of companies or bonds. HOW TO COUNT A central issue, discussed at European oil majors' shareholder meetings this year, is how they deal with the emissions caused by the products they sell, such as gasoline or kerosene, which are known as Scope 3 emissions. (GRAPHIC: Oil Majors' Carbon emissions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QX928M7/eikon.png) Such emissions are typically around six times larger than the combined emissions from oil companies' direct operations and power supply, also known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, according to Reuters calculations. Even if a company publishes Scope 3 data, there are 15 different categories based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. These include use of sold products such as fuel alongside secondary factors such as business travel or employee commuting. Constantine Pretenteris at Engaged Tracking said some companies achieved a high score for comprehensiveness by disclosing data for most of the Scope 3 categories, but left out the key ones, such as emissions from use of their fuel. ""We would love to see a general standard which makes comparisons easy,"" Sven Reinke of Moody's said. ""It doesn't fully exist these days."" RELATIVE OR ABSOLUTE The majority of climate-related targets are based on intensity measures, which means absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Total recorded Scope 3 emissions from the world's top public oil companies are still rising, largely due to rising oil and gas output, according to Reuters calculations based on data carried on Refinitiv's Eikon platform and company websites. They showed combined Scope 3 emissions recorded by BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips', Chevron, Eni, Total, Equinor and Repsol rose around 1.6per cent over 2018, after a 1per cent similar rise the previous year. Individual figures vary according to the metrics a company chooses to include. Conoco said its Scope 3 emissions had fallen 5per cent, while the other companies' individual recorded Scope 3 emissions either rose or stayed roughly the same. Asked for comment, BP and Chevron pointed to absolute targets related to their own operations. Total pointed to progress it had made towards lowering emissions intensity per unit produced. Shell and Repsol referred to their short-term intensity-based targets and Equinor said it could not take responsibility for emissions it does not control. U.S. firm Exxon did not reply to a request for comment. Eni had no immediate comment. Top oil companies have boosted investment in renewable energy and low-carbon technology in recent years, particularly in Europe, but much bigger sums are still going into developing oil and gas. ""We cannot change the patterns of consumption around the world - we cannot make people fly less. We can reduce the carbon intensity of the products we sell,"" Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in June. Mark Lewis from BNP Paribas and a member of TCFD, said overall cuts were what would count in the end. Repsol is currently the only major oil company to have set absolute reduction targets for all its output. ""The Paris Agreement is all about a carbon budget and that’s an absolute number. It’s not an intensity number,"" Lewis said. ""The atmosphere works in terms of absolutes not intensity."" In the meantime, some investors are avoiding oil companies which others say should be supported for going further than many of their peers. London-based investment management firm Sarasin & Partners said in June it was selling down its stake in Shell because its spending plans were out of synch with international climate targets. Asked for comment, Shell pointed to comments from representatives of the pension funds of the Church of England and Britain's government Environment agency, which praised the company's transparency and said others should follow its lead.

New IMF chief Georgieva says world suffering 'synchronised slowdown',,AFP/jt/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/new-imf-chief-georgieva-says-world-suffering-synchronised-11982220," WASHINGTON: Grinding trade disputes are undermining the global economy, which is set to see its slowest growth in nearly a decade, the new IMF chief said on Tuesday (Oct 8). Research shows the impact of the trade conflict is widespread and countries must be ready to respond in unison with cash infusions, Kristalina Georgieva said in her first speech as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She also called for a ramp-up in carbon taxes to address the other challenge facing the global economy - climate change. In 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 per cent of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,"" Georgieva said in a speech ahead of IMF-World Bank autumn meetings next week. ""This widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade."" She said the IMF is cutting its forecasts for growth this year and next. Previously, the world economy had been projected to expand by 3.2 per cent in 2019 and 3.5 per cent in 2020. The fund is due to release details in its updated World Economic Outlook on Oct 15. While trade tensions had been talked about as a danger to the economy, ""now, we see that they are actually taking a toll"", she said. ""Global trade growth has come to a near standstill."" For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around US$700 billion by 2020, or about 0.8 percent of GDP, she said, which is far higher than the fund previously forecast as its worst case scenario. That is an amount ""approximately the size of Switzerland's entire economy,"" she said. IMF research shows the secondary effects of the trade war - such as the loss of confidence and financial market reactions - are far greater than the direct economic impact of the tariffs. ""It is the indirect impacts that really bite,"" Georgieva said of the trade war during a forum following her speech. She warned that ""once undermined, confidence is hard to rebuild."" ""We are already shooting ourselves in the foot."" SPEND MORE President Donald Trump's trade war with China involves steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way commerce but there are conflicts with other trading partners as well. And even if growth resurges next year, some of the ""rifts"" already caused by the trade conflicts could cause ""changes that last a generation"", such as shifting supply chains, she said. ""The results are clear. Everyone loses in a trade war,"" Georgieva said. To protect against a sharp global slowdown, Georgieva called on countries with funds available to deploy their ""fiscal firepower"". While some governments are burdened by high debt levels, ""in places such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea, an increase in spending - especially in infrastructure and R&D - will help boost demand and growth potential"", she said. Many economies have been relying on central banks and low interest rates to support economic expansion, she warned that keeping rates low for too long can cause investors to engage in risky behaviour. The IMF estimates that if there were a major economic downturn, ""corporate debt at risk of default would rise to US$19 trillion, or nearly 40 per cent of the total debt in eight major economies. This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis,"" she said. ""This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis."" Georgieva, who this month took over leadership at the IMF from Christine Lagarde amid rising concerns about the world economy, called on global leaders ""to work together, now, and find a lasting solution on trade"". That includes resolving legitimate concerns over protection of proprietary technology, an issue at the center of Washington's dispute with Beijing. But she also said policymakers for too long have ignored the people harmed by globalization, which tends to be good for ""the educated, urban, younger people."" The key, she said, is to recognize that ""inequalities are a drag on multilateralism and drag on growth."" RAISING CARBON TAXES Meanwhile, Georgieva said addressing the climate change crisis will require a change in national tax systems that includes a big ramp up in levies on carbon emissions. ""It is a crisis where no one is immune and everyone has a responsibility to act,"" she said. ""Limiting global warming to a safe level requires a significantly higher carbon price,"" she said. But she added that ""the key here is to change tax systems, not simply add a new tax."" At the current average carbon price of US$2 a tonne, there is little incentive to make a transition to new forms of energy. These new tax revenues could be used to mitigate damage and ""also support investments in the clean energy infrastructure that will help the planet heal,"" she said."""
September 2019 equal hottest on record: Monitor,,AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/september-2019-equal-hottest-on-record-monitor-11971842,"  PARIS: Last month was the equal hottest September in history, the European Union's satellite monitoring service said on Friday (Sep 4), the fourth month in a row with near- or record-breaking temperatures. The Copernicus Climate Service said September 2019 was 0.57 degrees Celsius hotter than the historical average - on a par with September 2016. Last month was in fact very slightly warmer (0.02 degrees C) than September but the service said they were treating both as joint record-holders. The data continues Earth's hot streak, with June being the warmest June ever, July the warmest month in recorded history. August was the second hottest August since records began. Copernicus said its data was further evidence of our planet's long-term warming trend"". The service, which uses satellite imaging to observe ground-based climate trends, said it had registered significantly hotter than average months for the central and eastern United States, the Mongolian plateau and parts of the Arctic. Temperatures in Europe were lower than the September average, as they were in southwestern parts of Russia and parts of Antarctica. Yet the overall trend is hotter, according to Copernicus Director Jean-Noel Thepaut. ""The recent series of record-breaking temperatures is an alarming reminder of the long-term warming trend that can be observed on a global level,"" Thepaut said. ""With continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future."" Earth has warmed a little over 1 degree C since pre-industrial times and man-made emissions - as well as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases - are rising annually. Several peer-reviewed studies released this year showed that Earth had never in human history warmed so rapidly and uniformly as currently."""

Denmark made the proposal came during a meeting of EU environment ministers in Luxembourg. The EU aims to cut carbon emissions in the bloc by 40 per cent by 2030 while its executive, the Commission, plans to reduce them to zero by 2050 to help stop global warming. We need to acknowledge that we are in a bit of a hurry,"" Danish Climate and Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen told Reuters after the meeting. He said the diesel and petrol car ban will hopefully put pressure on the Commission to propose a phasing out of fossil fuel-powered vehicles in the bloc in the coming two decades. Denmark made headlines in October 2018 when its government announced that it would ban the sale of all fossil fuel-powered cars by 2030 but it subsequently scrapped the idea because this would have breached EU rules. Jorgensen said if the EU could not agree on a union-wide ban, it would be good if individual countries were allowed to implement such a measure. ""Plan A would be to make it a European ban,"" he said. Lithuania, Latvia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and several other countries however suggested that more must be done to stop the ""carbon leakage"" of selling second-hand autos from western Europe to the eastern region. Jorgensen said it was important to communicate the bloc's long-term policy directions to carmakers and that Denmark's next step was to set up an alliance with the 10 member states that support its proposal. ""Then I think others will follow,"" he said."""
Air France to offset daily CO2 emissions by next year,,AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/air-france-offset-daily-co2-emissions-2020-climate-change-11959436," PARIS: French carrier Air France will offset the carbon dioxide emissions of its 500-odd daily internal flights by 2020 at a cost of millions of euros, the company's CEO has announced. In a bid to counteract its climate impact, the company will finance projects that support tree planting, forest protection and the global shift to less polluting energy, Anne Rigail told Le Parisien newspaper. It is an investment of several million euros, she said in an interview published late Monday, adding the company was acting ""voluntarily"". Other projects would include banning single-use plastics such as cutlery from local flights as from January, and ""to start separating and recycling waste"" from October. The airline industry has been under fire over its carbon emissions, which at 285 grammes of CO2 emitted per kilometre travelled by each passenger, far exceed all other modes of transport, according to the European Environment Agency. Heavy duty transportation - freight trucking, shipping and aviation - represent over a tenth of global greenhouse gas emissions, says the World Resources Institute, a research body. The emissions contribute to global warming and climate change, which scientists say will unleash ever harsher droughts, superstorms, and sea-level rise. In July, France announced it would impose new taxes on plane tickets of between 1.50 and 18 euros per flight - a move criticised by Air France. It is meant to raise about 180 million euros a year to be invested in greener transport infrastructure. Rigail said she did not know if there had been a drop in passenger numbers due to a campaign of ""flight shaming"" (flygskam) spearheaded by 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, who has become a symbol of the fight against climate change."""

Organisers said 200,000 people joined a march in Milan while another major rally snaked through the centre of Rome. Demos were called in some 180 Italian cities. ""Be part of the solution, not the pollution,"" they yelled. Tens of thousands of people also marched in Vienna and other cities, making it Austria's biggest climate rally day so far. In Budapest, thousands of mostly schoolchildren took to the streets, exceeding past participation, with rallies held in several other Hungarian cities. They answered the call of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, the figurehead of the movement against climate change. She led the first of the major demos last week, when vast crowds filled the streets in cities worldwide.   Scientists warn time is running out for world leaders to curb global warming, blamed for an increase in environmental disasters. Schools in Italy and some schools in Austria let pupils out to join in the rallies - a trend already reported in several other countries during last week's rallies.

Pope urges Silicon Valley to avoid slide towards new 'barbarism',,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-urges-silicon-valley-to-avoid-slide-towards-new--barbarism--11949616," VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis urged Silicon Valley giants on Friday (Sep 27) to make sure technological advances such as artificial intelligence do not lead to a new form of barbarism"" where the law of the strongest prevails over the common good. Pope Francis made his comments in an address to participants at a Vatican conference attended by executives from companies such as Facebook, Mozilla, and Western Digital as well as Nobel laureates, Catholic ethicists, government regulators, internet entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists. The three-day gathering, which ends on Saturday, is discussing topics with tech jargon not commonly heard inside the Vatican such as algorithms and blockchain. ""The remarkable developments in the field of technology, in particular those dealing with artificial intelligence, raise increasingly significant implications in all areas of human activity. For this reason, open and concrete discussions on this theme are needed now more than ever,"" Pope Francis told the participants. They include Mitchell Baker, executive chairwoman of Mozilla, Gavin Corn, associate general counsel and director of the cyber security law team at Facebook, Western Digital senior vice president Jim Welsh and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn. Pope Francis said technology needed ""both theoretical and practical moral principles"". He warned of the dangers of the use of artificial intelligence ""to circulate tendentious opinions and false data that could poison public debates and even manipulate the opinions of millions of people, to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence"". ""If mankind’s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest,"" he said. The conference is taking place amid the rise of cyber espionage, online hate speech and misuse of private data, and signs the industry is struggling to respond. It is the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future, regardless of their religion. Vatican officials said it could provide material for a possible papal document on artificial intelligence, much as meetings with scientists helped shape his landmark 2015 encyclical ""Laudato Si"" on the protection of the environment and global warming."""
Commentary: I care about climate change. I don't wish to live in a Waterworld like Kevin Costner,27 Sep 2019 06:23AM (Updated: 31 Oct 2019 11:57AM),CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/rising-sea-levels-ipcc-report-singapore-impact-11944258," SINGAPORE: My paternal side of the family can trace back our history to the Riau islands in Indonesia. My father and his siblings grew up on Pulau Sekijang Pelepah, or what is now known as Lazarus Island in Singapore. Growing up, I have always felt a connection with the sea. When Waterworld starring Kevin Costner aired in the mid-1990s, the primary school kid that I was thought that the post-apocalyptic future with the complete melting of the polar ice caps, and sea levels rising above 7,000m covering all the continents was cool. Two decades later, after taking geography in school, actively volunteering on environmental issues, and learning about climate change, I am very certain I do not wish for such a future to ever befall us. SEA LEVEL RISE PROJECTIONS In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius. It mentioned the accelerating rise of sea levels rise in response to climate change, with risks projected to be the highest in South and Southeast Asia, assuming no upgrade to current protection levels, for all levels of climate warming. It also emphasised that 136 megacities are at risk from flooding due to sea level rise unless further adaptation is undertaken. Many of these cities are located in South and Southeast Asia. The IPCC released another report this week, highlighting sea level rise could reach 0.61m to 1.1m by 2100.   In the latest IPCC Special Report, IPCC chairman Dr Hoesung Lee said: If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable. ASEAN has a coastline that spans more than 170,000km. More than 640 million people live in this region. That is a lot of people to protect and manage in the face of rising sea levels. WHAT THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT IS DOING In July 2019, at the Partners for the Environment Forum, when Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli announced that the Centre for Climate Research Singapore will be launching a S$10 million National Sea Level Research Programme over the next five years to strengthen our understanding of sea levels around Singapore to help us develop more robust sea level rise projection, I was pleased. This announcement suggested Singapore is serious about protecting our low-lying island from sea level rise. Additionally, in August 2019, when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spent about a third of his National Day Rally on climate change, including highlighting how the country is preparing for rising sea levels, for example, possibly building polders to protect our eastern coastline, that same feeling of assurance that the Government is doing whatever they can to protect the country and its people rose in me. THE CLIMATE ACTION SUMMIT Speaking as someone actively volunteering in the Singapore environment scene over the past decade, I have seen a lot done over the years by our leaders - in terms of public efforts to address climate change, and engaging businesses, academic institutions, groups and community leaders.   These efforts are drawing more attention to the enormity of our climate change challenge and galvanising ground-up support, which is reaching a tipping point looking at the recent Singapore Climate Rally held at Hong Lim Park just over this weekend. But Singapore cannot tackle climate change by ourselves. In his speech at the Climate Action Summit, PM Lee acknowledged the catastrophic consequences of climate change, and reminded the audience Singapore contributes only 0.11 per cent of global emissions. He then highlighted several local actions such as the implementation of a carbon tax and the development of a long-term low emissions development strategy, as well as what we were doing for the region such as contributing S$5 million to the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, based in Singapore. He then concluded calling for member-states to redouble efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Perhaps that speech was apt for the purpose of a UN Climate Action Summit session touching on Towards a Resilient Future, and for other countries to hear and learn from. For me though, it was a narrative I have heard before. A part of me wished he had mentioned the rally over the weekend and how Singaporeans from all walks of life are now sitting up and taking serious notice. SOUTHEAST ASIA AT THE CLIMATE ACTION SUMMIT Aside from PM Lee, three other Southeast Asian Leaders spoke this week at the Climate Action Summit, signalling greater political recognition and resolve to address climate change.   Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla highlighted the reduction in Indonesia’s forest cover from 150 million hectares 50 years ago to 90 million hectares, what Indonesia is doing to restore peatlands and protect coastlines, and how they are transitioning away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy. Surabaya Mayor Tri Rismaharini focused on Surabaya and shared several initiatives including having a city bus where passengers can pay using plastic bottles. Thailand Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha delivered his statement on behalf of the 10 ASEAN member states. ASEAN is highly vulnerable since most people live in low-lying coasts and plains. He underscored ASEAN’s commitment to global climate actions, and how all members have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions. He also highlighted that ASEAN has exceeded its energy efficiency target, reducing energy intensity by more than 21.9 per cent compared to 2005, well ahead of its 2030 target. Overall, all the speakers including PM Lee emphasised the need to work together to tackle climate change in various ways. We can do much more to save our region and our people. I foresee the issue of ASEAN climate refugees, for example, being a very real possibility in my lifetime. THE HUGE OIL INDUSTRY While I acknowledge that Singapore is doing a lot to address climate change, I also cannot ignore several things. For example, on the Economic Development Board (EDB) website, we pride ourselves in refining 1.5 million barrels of oil per day. More than 100 global chemical firms are located here and this sector employs more than 25,000 people.   I am grateful for the jobs created and the workers’ contribution to the economy. But I wonder if there are any long-term studies being done to monitor the health of our workers in this sector, and the regular citizens living around them. I worry also about the impact of these industries on the environment and whether as a country, we are living up to our creed to shift away from the fossil fuel industry and minimise our carbon footprint. SO WHAT CAN WE DO SINGAPORE? I hope everyone spends a minute today to ask ourselves what is most important to us, and what we can do to change things for the better. Individual actions go beyond simple actions like using less water and less electricity, taking public transport, and bringing our BYOs. Individual actions can have the potential to influence others and create systemic changes. There are several initiatives in Singapore that need more public involvement. The public can practise active citizenry and be more involved in climate action. First, the National Climate Change Secretariat is calling for views on how Singapore can work towards becoming a low carbon global city-state. Anyone can give feedback online via the REACH website.   Second, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has launched a Youth Action Plan. Many things are happening here. The Youth Action Challenge: Environment is part of the SG Youth Action Plan and designed to support youths to influence policy change and start ground-up initiatives. Youths should sign up for these discussions. Third, Singaporeans should familiarise ourselves with Singapore's Fourth National Communication and Third Biennial Update Report. Specifically, we can learn more about what mitigation measures Singapore is taking. As individuals, we can reach out to decision-makers at firms we work at or care about, to minimise energy wastage and control emissions. Fourth, Singaporeans should recognise that adapting to climate change is a long-term effort. Significant investments will therefore have to be made early. As individuals, we can start talking to more people about how we are going to finance this and be prepared for future policy changes. Fifth, as individuals, another way we can influence more people and create systemic change is to reach out to our Members of Parliament and get them to actively raise climate questions at Parliament, or have working groups with their constituencies to push for more changes at the grassroots level.   Regardless of age, language, and religion, everyone has to play our part in climate action. I feel it is critical for individuals to feel immersed and empowered to do more. This is also where I see the importance of actively engaging with others on environmental issues and getting to know people who can strengthen our collective efforts. A Waterworld scenario may sound extreme now, but we are slowly heading towards that. There is not much time left. We must do what we can quickly.

Australia PM Scott Morrison lashes climate critics in UN speech,,AFP/ic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-pm-scott-morrison-climate-critics-un-greta-thunberg-11946290," NEW YORK: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison used his UN speech on Wednesday (Sep 26) to slam critics of his country's climate record and to suggest Swedish teen Greta Thunberg was being exploited by others for ulterior motives. Morrison, who snubbed a major UN climate summit two days earlier, also said the Great Barrier Reef was vibrant and resilient"", weeks after his own government downgraded the world heritage site's long-term outlook to ""very poor"" for the first time. ""Australia is doing our bit on climate change, and we reject any suggestion to the contrary,"" said Morrison, who as his country's treasurer famously brought a lump of coal to Australia's parliament to taunt the opposition over its commitment to renewable energy. ""We are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and our economic future,"" he added. Morrison charged that critics on climate change ""willingly overlook or perhaps ignore our achievements as the facts simply don't fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution."" He noted that Australia is responsible for only 1.3 per cent of global emissions, and that he had passed an A$3.5 billion climate solutions plan. The prime minister added that his country would meet its Paris Accord commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. He also implied that Swedish teen Greta Thunberg, who accused world leaders of betraying her generation in a speech two days earlier, was being manipulated.   Morrison said he received a great deal of letters from youngsters worried about the future, and that: ""We must respect and harness the passion and aspiration of our younger generations. ""And we must guard against others who would seek to compound, or worse baselessly exploit, their anxiety for other agendas."" GREAT BARRIER REEF Morrison's bullish assessments of his country's efforts to tackle climate catastrophe are not shared by environmentalists. With a population of around 25 million, Australia was the 15th biggest carbon dioxide emitter in 2016, and was second highest behind Saudi Arabia in emissions per capita, according to International Energy Agency data.   One of the world's biggest goal producers, its self-set Paris goals are rated by the Climate Action Tracker as ""insufficient"" and not consistent with holding long-term warming to under 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees needed to avert climate catastrophe. Earlier this week, veteran conservationist David Attenborough took aim at Morrison for not giving a ""damn"" about coal emissions and his lack of action on climate change.   In his speech, Morrison also called the Great Barrier Reef ""one of the world's most pristine areas of natural beauty"" and encouraged tourists to visit, adding it remained ""vibrant and resilient."" Last month, the Australian government agency that manages the reef said rising sea temperatures ""have resulted in coral reef habitat transitioning from poor to very poor condition."""""
"As China forges ecological future, Tibetans relinquish nomadic past",26 Sep 2019 12:43PM (Updated: 26 Sep 2019 12:50PM),Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-ecological-future-tibetans-nomad-past-11944446," MADOI, China: Former nomad Yanglo spent his youth tending yaks and sheep in the highlands of China's Qinghai province, but the Tibetan is now often found huddled over a sewing machine in his modest brick home around 160 km away stitching sheepskin coats. The 45-year-old was among tens of thousands of Tibetan nomads who resettled in rural townships in the early 2000s, wooed by financial compensation from a Chinese government keen to pull the region back from ecological disaster. Yanglo, who makes traditional Tibetan clothing to supplement his income as a park ranger in the upper Yellow River basin, is a model resettler. I am used to it now, and I don't plan to return to the grasslands,"" Yanglo told Reuters as he worked at his electric sewing machine in a resettlement village on the outskirts of Madoi county, around 2,000km from Beijing. That is fortunate for Yanglo, as the government plans to declare a 123,100 square kilometre area of alpine grasslands, wetlands and lakes - roughly equivalent in size to England - as a national park by the end of next year. That will officially block him and many other migrants from ever returning to their former pastoral life. China says the relocations have been key to saving the grasslands and helping Tibetans escape from poverty, but there is international concern the drive is coming at too high a cost, including the loss of cultural traditions and communities. The government was spurred into action at the turn of the century when the upper course of the Yellow River began drying up, depleted by agriculture, industrialisation and mining. The 5,464km river even failed to reach the sea in some years. Blaming global warming and overgrazing, China turned the upper basins of the Yangtze, Lancang (Mekong) and Yellow River into a nature reserve known as Sanjiangyuan. The government has invested more than 18 billion yuan (US$2.53 billion) in conserving the local ecology since 2005, and plans to further invest 900 million yuan this year. The government gave families who were willing to move from the area tens of thousands of yuan each in one-off compensation payments and thousands more yuan in recurring subsidies for grain and fuel. Almost 100,000 Tibetans have shifted to towns since 2005, according to state media. Yanglo, who like some Tibetans goes by one name, left his home on the shores of Gyaring and Ngoring, a pair of high-altitude lakes near the headwaters of the Yellow River, in 2003. Last year, he was given a brick house with a walled yard in a specially built village of about 1,000 homes. LOST IDENTITY There is little in Yanglo's home to remind his family of their nomadic past. His three children were all born after he had left the grasslands. ""My children are too young to know the difference, so I've borrowed a few yaks and let my children milk them,"" said Yanglo, speaking in Tibetan. ""At least they can be near the animals."" But his biggest wish is for his children ""to get a better education and acquire some culture"" by assimilating further. Ironically, that is what some human rights groups are worried about, fearing permanent mass migration will end a unique way of life. For Tibetans, the natural world is more than a source of corporeal sustenance. It is also a spiritual landscape inhabited by deities and demons that demand respect and sacrifice. Sonam Dargyal, who grew up in Lancang before becoming a physician in Yushu county, south of Madoi, has spent years collecting Tibetan folk tales, from stories of why a rock formation resembles a Buddha's head to flying lamas with magical powers. ""If we don't pass down these stories, future generations will have no knowledge of them,"" he said. ""Our folklore and our traditions will then be truly lost."" Others warn that the inability of many of the nomads to adapt to life in the townships effectively leaves them in no-man's land, culturally and socially, with many unable to communicate in Chinese and lacking skills to widen their employment horizons. ""In the grasslands, they are free and they are self-assured,"" said Meng Xiangjing, a professor in population and development studies at Renmin University in Beijing. To generate stable income, nomads are encouraged to explore work in areas such as scientific monitoring and ecological protection, as well as rural tourism and traditional handicraft production, the administration bureau of the Sanjiangyuan National Park said in a faxed statement. ""In principle, there is no large-scale relocation of nomads,"" the administration bureau of the Sanjiangyuan National Park told Reuters. ""We respect the will of the herders and guide them to relocate voluntarily."" Yet the creation of the national park effectively closes the door to return for anyone who lived within designated core zones, which comprise 75 per cent of the park, where human activity will be restricted and livestock herding banned. Some herding families still reside in the core zones, according to some Tibetans whom Reuters spoke to in the area, but they were unable to say whether or not the nomads are in the process of resettlement ahead of the 2020 opening of the national park. The park's administration bureau did not respond to a question about whether families remained in the core zones. Tenzin, a nomad who tends a herd of yaks across thousands of acres of grassland just outside the designated core zone of the national park, has resisted moving despite being given a house in Madoi county, which his younger daughters live in during school terms. The 35-year-old, his wife and adolescent son, who spend their days herding and milking yaks and picking up slabs of yak dung for use as fuel, can stay put in the highlands for now. But Tenzin is uneasy about the future. ""I'll be very sad if my son inherits the land to then give it up,"" he said."""
"Mont Blanc glacier at risk of collapse, PM calls for climate action",25 Sep 2019 07:40PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/mont-blanc-glacier-collapse-risk-italy-climate-action-11942218," MILAN: Part of a glacier on Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain, is at risk of collapse, prompting Italian authorities to close roads and evacuate Alpine hamlets and the prime minister to call for action to tackle global warming. A section estimated to contain up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice could fall down the mountain, the mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur, Stefano Miserocchi, said in a statement on Tuesday (Sep 24). Miserocchi ordered the closing of two roads and the evacuation of huts on the mountain, which is 4,800m high, after experts said the Planpincieux glacier was sliding at an increased speed, threatening part of the Ferret Valley.   Between the end of August and the beginning of September the lower part of the glacier was sliding at a speed of 50cm to 60cm per day. These phenomena show once more how the mountain is experiencing a period of great changes due to climate factors, so it is especially vulnerable"", Miserocchi said.   Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking on Wednesday at the UN General Assembly, said ""news that a glacier on the Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that can't leave us indifferent, it must shake us up and we have to mobilise."" Across the Alps there is concern that warmer temperatures are increasing the danger of melting permafrost and disappearing glaciers."""
Once-a-century weather catastrophes to occur at least once a year by 2050: UN report,25 Sep 2019 06:32PM (Updated: 25 Sep 2019 06:50PM),AFP/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/once-century-weather-catastrophes-occur-once-year-un-climate-11941748," MONACO: By 2050, many coastal megacities and small island nations will experience once-a-century weather catastrophes every year, even with an aggressive drawdown of greenhouse gas emissions, a major United Nations (UN) report said on Wednesday (Sep 25). More than a billion people will, by mid-century, be living in areas prone to cyclones, large-scale flooding and other extreme weather events amplified by rising seas, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected.    It also highlighted that since 2005, sea levels have risen 2.5 times faster than during the 20th century due to melting sheets. This will likely jump four-fold again by 2100 if carbon emissions continue unabated, said the report. Regardless of emissions scenarios, we face a world of higher sea levels,"" said co-author Bruce Glavovic, a professor at Massey University, New Zealand, noting that humanity is concentrated on the world's shorelines. ""It doesn't take a big rise in sea level to lead to catastrophic problems,"" he added. ""Sea level rise is not a slow onset problem - it's a crisis of extreme weather events.""   CRUMBLING ICE SHEETS ""Even if we manage to limit global warming, we will continue to see major changes in the oceans,"" said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a researcher at the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences and an IPCC co-chair. ""But it will at least buy us some time, both for future impacts and to adapt."" The underlying 900-page scientific report is the fourth such UN tome in less than a year, with others focused on a 1.5 degrees Celsius cap on global warming, the decline of biodiversity, as well as land use and the global food system.    All four conclude that humanity must overhaul how it produces, distributes and consumes almost everything to avoid the worst ravages of global warming and environmental degradation. By absorbing a quarter of manmade CO2 and soaking up more than 90 per cent of the heat generated by greenhouse gases, oceans have kept the planet livable - but at a terrible cost, the report finds. Seas have grown acidic, potentially undermining their capacity to draw down CO2; warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms; marine heatwaves are wiping out coral reefs, which are unlikely to survive the century. Most threatening of all, accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially Earth's ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica are driving the sea level to rise.    HEFTY PRICE TAG Some cities, such as New York, are planning to spend tens of billions of dollars - and probably far more - to shore up their defences. Indeed, building dikes and levees along with other measures would reduce the risk of flooding caused by sea level rise and storm surges over the next 80 years by 100- to 1,000-fold, according to the IPCC report's 42-page Summary for Policy Makers. But with a hefty price tag: Up to hundreds of billions of dollars a year.  For many megacities and sprawling delta cities in the developing world, however, an engineered solution will be impractical or prohibitively expensive.   Under the IPCC's consensus rules, all countries must sign off on the language of the report's executive summary, designed to provide leaders with objective, science-based information. The five-day meeting in Monaco went deep into overtime when Saudi Arabia objected what might have been a routine reference to the October 2018 IPCC report on the feasibility of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for capping global warming at ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, and 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. As a result, passages in the final draft were scrubbed, including one estimate that humanity's ""carbon budget"" - the amount of CO2 we can emit without breaching a temperature barrier - for a 1.5 degrees Celsius world could be as short as eight years, according to a copy seen by AFP."""
Attenborough calls out Australia's climate stance,24 Sep 2019 03:44PM (Updated: 24 Sep 2019 03:50PM),AFP/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/attenborough-calls-out-australia-s-climate-stance-11937704," SYDNEY: Veteran conservationist David Attenborough has taken aim at Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for not giving a damn"" about coal emissions and his lack of action on climate change. The British natural historian said in an interview broadcast Tuesday (Sep 24) that Morrison's conservative government had backed away from Australia's previous commitments to take action on global warming. ""Australia, it seemed to me, were saying all the right things - previous governments were,"" he told national broadcaster ABC. ""And you are keepers of an extraordinary section of the surface of this planet, including the Barrier Reef,"" he said ""what you say, what you do, really, really matters."" Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was ousted in 2018 in part due to his attempt to make climate emissions targets law. Morrison, his successor, has stopped short of denying climate change, but continues to focus on boosting coal exports. In the lead up to his surprise election victory this year Morrison took a political gamble when he green-lit the controversial Adani coal mine in northern Australia. This week he snubbed a UN climate summit in New York after it emerged he would not be invited to speak for lack of new climate announcements. Attenborough took aim at Canberra for adopting a position of it ""doesn't matter how much coal we burn"" and for not giving ""a damn what it does to the rest of the world"". When treasurer in 2017, Morrison famously brandished a lump of coal in parliament in defence of his party's energy policies. ""I didn't think it was a joke,"" Attenborough said of Morrison bringing the coal to parliament. ""And if you weren't opening a coal mine, OK, I would agree, it's a joke. But you are opening a coal mine."""""
Indonesian forest fires putting 10 million children at risk: UN,24 Sep 2019 03:32PM (Updated: 24 Sep 2019 07:41PM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesian-forest-fires-haze-children-health-risk-11937492," JAKARTA: Indonesian forest fires are putting nearly 10 million children at risk from air pollution, the United Nations warned Tuesday (Sep 24), as scientists said the blazes were releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. The fires have been spewing toxic haze over Southeast Asia in recent weeks, closing schools and airports, with people rushing to buy face masks and seek medical treatment for respiratory ailments.  Jakarta has deployed tens of thousands of personnel and water-bombing aircraft to tackle the slash-and-burn blazes set to clear agricultural land. The fires are an annual problem but this year are the worst since 2015 due to dry weather.   Almost 10 million people under 18 - about a quarter below five - live in the areas worst affected by fires on Indonesia's Sumatra island and the country's part of Borneo island, the UN children's agency UNICEF said. Small children are especially vulnerable due to undeveloped immune systems while babies born to mothers exposed to pollution during pregnancy may have low birth weights and be delivered early, they said. Poor air quality is a severe and growing challenge for Indonesia,"" said Debora Comini from UNICEF. ""Every year, millions of children are breathing toxic air that threatens their health and causes them to miss school - resulting in lifelong physical and cognitive damage.""   Thousands of schools have been closed across Indonesia due to poor air quality, with millions of youngsters missing classes. Schools were forced to shut across Malaysia last week as dense smog from its neighbour clouded the skies, while Singapore was also shrouded in haze during the weekend's Formula One motor race.   Air quality improved in Malaysia Tuesday and was at ""moderate"" levels on an official index in most places with the skies looking largely clear, while the haze had lifted from Singapore. A regional forecasting centre said the number of ""hotspots"" - areas of intense heat detected by satellite which indicate a likely fire - had fallen sharply on Sumatra. Fires on the island are usually blamed for belching smog over Malaysia and Singapore. There have been a series of wildfire outbreaks worldwide, from the Amazon to Australia, and scientists are increasingly worried about their impact on global warming. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, part of the EU's Earth observation programme, said this year's Indonesian fires were releasing almost as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as blazes in 2015, the worst for two decades. From the start of August to Sep 18, the fires emitted about 360 megatonnes of the greenhouse gas, compared to 400 megatonnes over the same period four years ago, the service said. One megatonne is equivalent to one million tonnes. At the peak of the 2015 crisis, the fires were emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each day than all US economic activity, according to environmental watchdog the World Resources Institute."""
Mumbai fears for homes and lives amid rising seas,24 Sep 2019 12:02PM (Updated: 24 Sep 2019 12:10PM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/mumbai-india-homes-lives-affected-global-warming-rising-seas-11936870," MUMBAI: Huge swathes of Mumbai's beaches have already been lost to rising seas. Now shanty dwellers fear for their homes and critics say India's largest metropolis - like other world mega-cities - is not doing enough to hold back the waves. During the monsoon, near-daily storms regularly flood Dharavi, one of Asia's biggest slums and home to some of the coastal city's most vulnerable residents. The situation has been getting worse every year, with our homes knee-deep in water,"" Venkatesh Nadar, 38, who has lived in the shanty settlement his entire life, told AFP. Nadar said authorities have not told him what might happen to his home as sea levels rise, or if they are doing anything to help his family move. ""It's dangerous and worrying for our children's future, and leaves every family living here at God's mercy,"" he said. If a dire UN prediction saying that the sea could rise by one metre in the century up to 2100 because of global warming comes true, one academic report suggests a quarter of Mumbai could be affected. Even a 20cm rise would more than double the frequency of flooding in tropical zones such as the Mumbai coast, according to a 2017 report by US experts. Mumbai, which British colonial rulers formed by joining seven small islands, is already vulnerable to floods because so much of it is below the high-tide line. The shore has retreated by more than 20m at some Mumbai beaches over the past 15 years, according to studies by the Watchdog Foundation activist group. Hundreds have died and billions of dollars of damage caused in floods over the past two decades - and one storm alone in 2005 left 500 dead. Floodwaters already overwhelm Mumbai's decrepit drainage system every monsoon. The Maharashtra state government's response has concentrated on building 20 sea walls - including four off Mumbai - and a huge mangrove planting campaign along the state's 720km coast. Offshore reefs and beach restoration plans are also being considered. Mangroves act as sponges to soak up excess rain and stormwater, and hundreds of thousands of saline-resistant trees and shrubs have been planted in a bid to create tropical tidal forests that act as a buffer against sea surges. NATURAL DEFENCES Forestry officer D R Patil and his 300 staff wade through knee-deep water to plant the trees and make sure they are protected. ""Mangroves are the first line of defence against flooding and we don't have any other options,"" Patil told AFP at the Airoli mangrove plantation on Mumbai's fringe. ""Even a boundary wall cannot protect the city as much as mangroves."" Maharashtra authorities have given mangroves protected status, and have powers to stop development on wetlands, remove slums and build walls. Patil said there are now more than 30,000 hectares of mangroves after boosting cover in the state by 82 per cent between 2015 and 2017. Environmentalists, however, say the action is a half-hearted response. While mangroves are important, the loss of natural drainage systems such as rivers and creeks was also crucial, said activist Nandkumar Pawar. He said some laws meant to protect the coast have been ""relaxed"" so that new buildings had crept closer to the shore, covering rivers and creeks that also provided an escape route for floodwaters. Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology believes that the increased frequency of flooding in the mega-city calls for extra defences - as well as a warning system to protect the growing population. ""We need to have a long-term vision,"" Koll told AFP. Amid all the criticism, Maharashtra Maritime Board deputy director Jitendra Raisinghani said hard-pressed state authorities were working on a coastal management plan. ""We are doing the best as per our capacity and resources,"" he said. ""There is never enough and you can do more."" Stalin Dayanand, an outspoken activist with the Vanashakti environmental group, said there had to be more natural defences. ""We are using measures which will increase conflict with nature by relying on civil engineering solutions like building walls,"" he said, adding that more deaths and damage were inevitable."""
China pledges new impetus in climate efforts after 2020,24 Sep 2019 10:49AM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-pledge-impetus-climate-change-efforts-global-warming-11936698," SHANGHAI: China will inject new impetus into climate change efforts after 2020, and use its Belt and Road initiative to boost cooperation in the fight on global warming, the government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said. China has promised to show the highest possible ambition"" when reviewing its climate commitments next year, raising hopes that the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter would include stronger targets in a five-year plan from 2021. Wang, who is representing President Xi Jinping at a United Nations climate summit this week in New York, said China would aim to step up efforts to cut climate-warming greenhouse gases after next year. A ""green"" Belt and Road programme would strengthen global cooperation on climate change, he added in a statement. Beijing has already pledged a target date of around 2030 for a peak in greenhouse gas emissions, but the Paris accord on climate change urges nations to make stronger pledges if possible. Government researchers have urged China to bring the target forward, but cautious officials have warned economic uncertainty could jeopardise even existing pledges. ""In light of tough economic and geopolitical prospects, China is weighing its options on climate,"" said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with environmental group Greenpeace. ""China's statement today keeps Beijing's intentions ambiguous, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a decision to double down on climate targets in 2020."" China will also propose 150 new initiatives to mitigate annual carbon emissions by as much as 10 billion to 12 billion tonnes through the use of natural solutions, such as reforestation, Wang added. China has championed the use of ""nature-based solutions"", such as the expansion of forests, grasslands and wetlands, as well as the use of biomass energy."""
'How dare you?' Greta Thunberg asks world leaders at UN summit,23 Sep 2019 11:34PM (Updated: 24 Sep 2019 11:43PM),AFP/ga/de,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/how-dare-you-greta-thunberg-asks-world-leaders-at-un-summit-11935542," NEW YORK: A visibly angry Greta Thunberg berated world leaders at a UN climate summit on Monday (Sep 23), accusing them of betraying her generation by failing to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and asking How dare you?"" The impassioned speech set the tone for the meeting, called by UN chief Antonio Guterres to reinvigorate the faltering Paris agreement, which 66 countries have responded to with vows to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  It comes as mankind is releasing more emissions into the atmosphere than at any point in history, triggering global weather hazards from heat waves to intense hurricanes to raging wildfires and rapidly acidifying oceans. Yet the gap between carbon reduction targets demanded by scientists to avert catastrophe and actions thus far taken is only widening. ""I shouldn't be up here. I should be back at school on the other side of the ocean,"" said Thunberg, 16, who has become the global face of a growing youth movement against climate inaction that mobilised millions in a worldwide strike on Friday. ""You come to us young people for hope. How dare you?"" she thundered, her voice at times breaking with emotion. ""We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"" In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump made a brief unscheduled appearance on Monday at the UN climate summit, which he had been expected to skip entirely. Trump, who has repeatedly expressed doubt about the overwhelming scientific consensus on manmade causes of global warming, spent a few minutes in the hall of the General Assembly where he applauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech then left. Earlier, opening the summit, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: ""The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win."" French President Emmanuel Macron invited his counterparts from Chile, Colombia and Bolivia to a meeting where US$500 million in extra funds were pledged by the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and non-profit Conservation International to protect the world's rainforests. Fewer than half the 136 heads of government or state in New York this week to attend the UN General Assembly will be present on Monday. BRAZIL, AUSTRALIA ABSENT Among those absent are President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, under whose leadership the Amazon rainforest is continuing to burn at record rates, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison whose government has pursued an aggressively pro-coal agenda. China, the world's biggest carbon emitter by far but also a leader in renewables, was represented by foreign minister Wang Yi who called on developed countries to lead by example in reducing emissions - but also said China was respecting its climate change promises. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the Paris agreement, told AFP the summit represented a ""moment of truth"" but was also taking place at a time of great political headwinds. ""There's a tension between the countries that want to go ahead to translate their goals into real policies"" and those that do not, she said. ""We can hope for the best, that this group of progressive countries and actors and local authorities prepare for the second wave, to demonstrate that this is where modernity is, where progress is, and even where economic growth could be."" INCREASED URGENCY In his speech, Macron made a clear reference to Thunberg and the other young speakers who preceded him. ""No official can remain deaf to this demand for inter-generational justice,"" he said. ""We need this youth to help us change things ... and put more pressure on those who do not want to move."" He also lauded Russia, which ratified the Paris agreement on Monday, and said Europe must do more, repeating a vow to close coal-fired plants by 2022. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized by activists for not doing enough, said it was her government's responsibility to ""take everyone along with them,"" including those who doubt climate change. Guterres has asked countries to bring ""concrete, realistic plans"" to enhance commitments made in 2015 in Paris toward the goal of limiting long-term warming to less than two degrees Celsius - and ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius - over pre-industrial levels. These are deemed important to avoid hitting a number of so-called ""tipping points,"" like the melting of polar permafrost, that could trigger irreversible warming and fundamentally alter weather events and ecosystems. But officials have been careful to manage expectations and say Monday's summit is also a run-up event to the 2020 UN climate summit that the UK will host in Glasgow."""
Pension funds and insurers pledge climate action at UN summit,23 Sep 2019 08:35PM,Reuters/ga,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pension-funds-and-insurers-pledge-climate-action-at-un-summit-11934988," NEW YORK: Insurers and pension funds managing US$2.3 trillion (1.85 trillion pounds) pledged on Monday (Sep 23) to shift their portfolios away from carbon-heavy industries in the hope of triggering snowballing climate commitments from other big investors. German insurer Allianz, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), and Swedish pension fund Alecta were among the founders of the new Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance"" launched at a United Nations climate summit. ""Mitigating climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. Politics, business and societies across the globe need to act as one to rapidly reduce climate emissions,"" Oliver Baete, chief executive of Allianz, said in a statement. As accelerating climate impacts become increasingly apparent via heatwaves, wildfires and receding coastlines, the financial sector is under growing pressure from activists, shareholders and regulators to respond. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who organized Monday's summit to try to boost stalling international efforts to control emissions, sees insurers and pensions funds as a crucial lever to transition the global economy off fossil fuels. These types of companies - called ""asset owners"" because they are the principal holders of retirement savings, or are investing customers' insurance premiums - represent some of the world's largest pools of capital. Members of the new grouping pledged to align their portfolios with a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming to limit the increase in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The importance of this target was underscored late last year when a report by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the catastrophic consequences for people and nature if the world is allowed to get much hotter. Under current emissions pledges by governments, the Earth is on track for well over 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century - an outcome that scientists say could put the survival of modern industrial societies at risk. ""CalPERS recognizes that climate change poses urgent and systemic risk given our responsibility to protect our members' financial assets and provide the long-term returns that can pay pensions for this and coming generations,"" said Marcie Frost, chief executive of CalPERS. THREAT TO DIVEST The pension funds and insurers said they would rebalance their portfolios to ensure their investments were carbon neutral by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2025, 2030 and 2040. They also pledged to make regular public progress reports. The nucleus of founding members hope they will influence an ever-growing proportion of the world's other big pension funds and insurers to push high-carbon companies towards more sustainable economic activities. But members of the new grouping said they might also have to divest from heavily-polluting industries as a last resort if they proved unwilling to change their business models so they no longer pose a danger to the stability of the climate. Michael Sabia, the chief executive of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), one of Canada's biggest pension funds, said there could be huge opportunities for investors willing to finance a fast transition to clean energy. ""There's a lot of people who don't get it, but I do think it's moving – the issue is whether it's moving fast enough,"" Sabia told Reuters. ""It's speed that matters here."" The new coalition was organized by groups including the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative and Mission2020, a network to spur faster climate action led by Christiana Figueres, a former U.N. climate chief. Among the other founding members are PensionDanmark, Swedish pension manager AMF, Nordea Life & Pension, Norwegian insurer Storebrand, and Swiss RE."""
Banks worth US$47 trillion adopt new UN-backed climate principles,23 Sep 2019 02:10AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/banks-worth-us-47-trillion-adopt-new-un-backed-climate-principles-11932674," UNITED NATIONS: Banks with more than US$47 trillion in assets, or a third of the global industry, adopted new U.N.-backed responsible banking"" principles to fight climate change on Sunday that would shift their loan books away from fossil fuels. Deutsche Bank , Citigroup and Barclays were among 130 banks to join the new framework on the eve of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at pushing companies and governments to act quickly to avert catastrophic global warming. ""These principles mean banks have to consider the impact of their loans on society – not just on their portfolio,"" Simone Dettling, banking team lead for the Geneva-based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative, told Reuters. Under pressure from investors, regulators and climate activists, some big banks have acknowledged the role lenders will need to play in a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy. Financing for oil, gas and coal projects has come under particular scrutiny as climate scientists step up calls to change the global economy's deep reliance on fossil-fuels to avert disastrous warming. The principles, drawn up jointly by U.N. officials and banks, require lenders to: - Align their strategies with the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming and U.N.-backed targets to fight poverty called the Sustainable Development Goals - Set targets to increase ""positive impacts"" and reduce ""negative impacts"" on people and the environment - Work with clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices - Be transparent and accountable about their progress. The principles' main backers say the norms will encourage banks to pivot their loan portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets and redirect capital to greener industries. Critics argue that banks should go much further by explicitly committing to phasing out financing for fossil fuel projects and agribusiness that drive deforestation in the Amazon, Southeast Asia and other regions. However, the new standards could also force participating banks to choose between foregoing business from clients in high-carbon sectors and the risk of being accused of backsliding on the principles if they continue to finance such firms. Although the initiative is voluntary, Dettling, who played a central role during 18 months of negotiations with a core group of 30 founding banks, said lenders would be reluctant to accept the reputational risk of losing their signatory status. ""They need to demonstrate that they are making progress — and progress within a given timeline,"" Dettling said. ""Ultimately, banks that are not in line with their commitments and do not make progress can be stripped of their signatory status,"" she said. Banks in Europe, in particular, also face growing regulatory pressure to disclose their exposure to the potential impact of climate-related disasters and a low-carbon energy transition on their asset base. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has joined counterparts in France and the Netherlands to push for better supervision of climate risk, was due to address the U.N. climate summit on Monday, according to a draft agenda. Other banks to join the ""Principles for Responsible Banking"" initiative included Danske Bank , ABN Amro , BNP Paribas , Commerzbank , Lloyds Banking Group and Societe Generale , according to a statement.

Big companies commit to slash emissions ahead of UN climate summit,22 Sep 2019 12:41PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/big-companies-commit-to-slash-emissions-ahead-of-un-climate-summit-11931680," UNITED NATIONS: Almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash their greenhouse gas emissions in a new campaign to steer multi-nationals towards a low-carbon future, organizers said on Sunday. We Mean Business, a coalition of advocacy groups, said dozens of companies had joined the initiative in the two months leading up to a United Nations summit taking place on Monday, which aims to spur faster action on climate change. “Now we need many more companies to join the movement, sending a clear signal that markets are shifting,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. The coalition was launched in June with a call to action by the United Nations, business and civil society leaders. The first 28 companies to join announced the following month. We Mean Business said 87 companies are now involved, with total market capitalization of more than US$2.3 trillion. Some companies in the coalition have agreed to slash their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, including Swiss food company Nestle, French building materials company Saint-Gobain, and French cosmetics maker L'Oreal. Others have stopped short of committing to go carbon neutral but say they will align their operations with a goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This group includes Finnish telecoms company Nokia, French food group Danone and British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, We Mean Business said. As accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather outpace climate models, scientists say the world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming. With fossil fuel companies still developing new oil and gas fields and many developing countries expanding coal-fired power, the coalition's pledges are minuscule relative to rising global emissions. Some experts have questioned whether publicly traded companies committed to maximizing shareholder returns will be able to make the sweeping investments required to fight climate change. Yet many investors have been pressuring companies to act on climate risks, and chief executives also face pressure from an upsurge in youth-led activism, which mobilized millions around the world to protest on Friday. We Mean Business believes pledges by a core of mostly European, and some North American and Asian companies, to commit to independently-verified emissions targets will prompt others to follow suit. “These bold companies are leading the way towards a positive tipping point where 1.5°C-aligned corporate strategies are the new normal for businesses and their supply chains around the world, said Lise Kingo, chief executive of the U.N. Global Compact, which promotes responsible business practices. U.N. chief Guterres sees the private sector as crucial to securing more ambitious pledges at Monday's Climate Action Summit in New York, which aims to boost the Paris deal before it enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Companies such as Danish power group Orsted, Spanish energy company Iberdrola and German insurer Allianz are due to speak alongside governments at the one-day gathering, according to a draft agenda.

Refugees from rising seas: No place to call home,21 Sep 2019 06:03PM (Updated: 21 Sep 2019 06:10PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/refugees-rising-sea-levels-climate-change-11930226," MONACO: Most refugees fleeing persecution, famine or civil strife dream of one thing: Going home some day. But when rising seas displace hundreds of millions of people - a near certainty, scientists say - it will be an exodus with no hope of return. With sea level rise, we are talking about migrations without the option for a round-trip,"" Francois Gemenne, an expert on the intersection between geopolitics and the environment, and director of the Hugo Observatory in Liege, Belgium, told AFP. The global ocean waterline has crept up 15 to 20 centimetres since 1900, a direct effect of climate change. Until recently, that added volume was mostly due to water expanding as it warms. Today, however, meltwater from glaciers and especially ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica has become the main driver. The pace of sea level rise has also picked up, increasing nearly three-fold in the last decade compared to the previous century, a landmark UN assessment of oceans and Earth's frozen spaces to be unveiled next week will report. How high the oceans will be lifted by 2100 depends mainly on how much Earth heats up. If humanity caps global warming at two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels - the cornerstone goal of the Paris climate treaty - seas will rise by about half-a-metre, according to a draft of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report seen by AFP. A TRICKLE TO A TORRENT A 3C or 4C world in which efforts to curb greenhouse emissions have fallen short will likely see an increase closer to a metre, enough to wreak havoc in dozens of coastal megacities and render many island nations uninhabitable. ""Some small islands in the Pacific and Indian Ocean are merely one to two metres above sea level,"" Carlos Fuller, lead climate negotiator for the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), told AFP. ""A 1.2-metre rise would totally submerge these states."" But even these dire impacts are a trickle compared to the torrent to come because ice sheets will continue to shed mass for hundreds of years, scientists warn. In the 22nd century, the pace of sea-level rise is likely to jump 100-fold from 3.6 millimetres per year today to several centimetres annually. Even if global warming is capped at 2C, oceans will eventually rise enough to submerge areas home to 280 million people today, according to the IPCC report. The potential for destruction - already evident today - comes mainly from tropical storm surge. ""Two degrees of warming translates into more than 4.5 metres of sea level rise, probably six,"" Ben Straus, CEO and chief scientist of Climate Central, told AFP. ""That's enough to erase most of the cities on the coastlines across the world today."" Local and national governments around the world are starting to come to grips with the reality of current and future sea level rise. ENGINEERED SOLUTIONS Some countries are getting ahead of the problem by moving vulnerable populations. Indonesia announced last month that it will relocate its capital - along with millions of it residents - from Jakarta to Borneo. Vietnam, meanwhile, is engineering an exodus from parts of the Mekong Delta to higher ground. Local governments in Florida and Louisiana have created incentives to move people from flood-prone areas, and Britain has earmarked at least one vulnerable village in Wales to be ""decommissioned"".   ""The message is that sea level rise is affecting the rich and the poor, developed and developing countries,"" said Fuller. Some are taking an engineering approach. New York, for example, has a plan likely to cost tens of billions to protect parts of the city inundated in 2012 by Hurricane Sandy. ""A lot of places will build higher and higher levies,"" said Strauss. ""But as we adapt to sea level rise, we need to ask ourselves: How deep a bowl do we want to live in?"" Strauss' research, which informs the IPCC report, has estimated what percentage of the population in hundreds of major coastal cities today are in zones that will eventually be submerged with 2C of warming. SEA LEVEL TRIAGE ""Consider the political instability that has been triggered by relatively small levels of migration today,"" Strauss said. ""I shudder to think of the future world when tens of millions of people are moving because the ocean is eating their land."" Cities with five million inhabitants or more in which at least 20 per cent of today's population would eventually be displaced in a 2C world include: Barisal and Chittagong in Bangladesh (38 and 42 per cent of the cities' current populations); Hong Kong, Huaiyin, Jiangmen, Nantong and Taizhou in China (31, 42, 55, 72 and 67 per cent); Calcutta and Mumbai in India (24 and 27 per cent); Nagoya and Osaka in Japan (27 and 26 per cent); Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (28 and 45 per cent); Lagos, Manila, Bangkok (23, 26 and 42 per cent). ""Governments are going to have to decide which zones they are going to protect with dikes and levees, and which zones they are willing to sacrifice,"" said Gemenne. There is an ethical dimension to the problem as well, said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. ""People with means can move elsewhere,"" he told AFP. ""People without those means get stuck in dangerous areas that will be flooded and subject to toxic tides."""""
Environmental activists get down and dirty on mass cleanup day,21 Sep 2019 04:13PM (Updated: 22 Sep 2019 03:38AM),AFP/hs/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/world-cleanup-day-asia-climate-change-11930134," PARIS: Thousands of volunteers wielding nets and bin bags scoured coasts, parks and riverbanks across the globe on Saturday (Sep 21), in a litter-picking drive highlighting the vast quantity of trash dumped worldwide, a day after mass international climate protests. Campaigners took part in World Cleanup Day from Manila to the Mediterranean, as hundreds of thousands of people across the world take part in demonstrations and activities calling for urgent action on the environment. Young people have been at the forefront of the movement, with masses of children skipping school on Friday for a global climate strike, which teen activist Greta Thunberg said was only the beginning"".   It kicked off a week of climate action called for by Thunberg, who was among several hundred young activists attending a climate summit at the United Nations on Saturday. The World Cleanup Day on Saturday is an initiative that has got millions into the streets and cleaning up litter across the globe since it began just over a decade ago. In France, volunteers posted images of their trash hauls on social media - heaps of assorted waste, soft drink cans and plastic containers. A climate protest on the streets of Paris attracted some 15,000 people, according to a tally by independent consultancy Occurrence, but the rally was marred by clashes between security forces and a relatively small number of troublemakers. ""The conditions for a non-violent march are not in place,"" Greenpeace, a co-organiser of the event, said on Twitter, as police fired teargas at protesters. ""FOR US TO HELP"" While the types of trash collected varied, the common material in the bin bags across the planet was plastic, amid surging concerns over the environmental costs of single use items and microplastics in world waterways. Plastic pollution is a major problem across Southeast Asia, but particularly in the Philippines, which - along with China, Vietnam and Indonesia - is frequently listed among the world's worst offenders. In the Philippine capital, some 10,000 people swept across a long stretch of beach on heavily polluted Manila Bay, clutching sacks they filled with rubbish.   ""It's for us to help the environment, especially here in Manila, there's a lot of garbage,"" Mae Angela Areglado, a 20-year-old student told AFP as she pitched in with the cleanup - held right next to the city's huge Baseco slum. ""(Plastic is) affecting the marine life because they think that it is food,"" she added. In the Pacific island nation of Fiji, which is among the countries worst affected by sea level rises and has become a vocal advocate for global climate action, people scoured palm-fringed beaches west of the capital Suva, heaving discarded car tyres and engine parts from the coast. On Australia's Bondi beach activists sifted through the sand, carting off bits of plastic and cigarette butts.   CONSUMPTION CONCERNS The mass cleanup is coordinated by the Let's Do It Foundation, which began life in Estonia and says that 18 million people from 157 countries participated in the global cleanup day last year. This year, it says more than 160 countries are taking part. ""Garbage is a global problem and it affects all the people in the world. It knows no state borders,"" said the organisation's president Heidi Solba in a statement. The group said about 30,000 people are participating in Estonia on Saturday in a drive focusing on small litter like bottle tops and cigarette butts. Mart Normet, leader of the initiative in Estonia, said he drew hope from the enthusiasm of young people.   ""When I look at the new photos on Facebook, I can see that the new generation is bringing a completely new attitude. Littering and damaging consumption are a thing of the past,"" he said. In Vietnam's capital Hanoi, around 1,400 volunteers went searching for litter under the scorching sun.   ""Although our actions are very small - like cleaning trash from the sidewalk - it could spread a meaningful message,"" 18-year-old Hoang Thi Hoan told AFP, as motorists zipped by on a busy street. Friday's strike organisers 350.org said the youth-led rallies were the start of 5,800 protests across 163 countries over the next week. UN chief Antonio Guterres met young activists in New York on Saturday, telling them: ""There is a change in momentum ... due to your initiative and to the courage, with which you have started these movements."" A landmark UN report to be unveiled next week will warn global warming and pollution are ravaging Earth's oceans and icy regions in ways that could unleash misery on a global scale. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in August that the level of microplastics in drinking-water is not yet dangerous for humans but called for more research into potential future risk and a reduction in plastic waste. Seventy-nine percent of the plastic ever made has ended up dumped, with little reused or destroyed despite recycling and other initiatives to curb use, a UN report from 2018 said."""
"In tech 'awakening,' US workers at Google, Amazon join climate protests",21 Sep 2019 06:05AM (Updated: 21 Sep 2019 07:20AM),Reuters/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/in-tech--awakening---us-workers-at-google--amazon-join-climate-protests-11929628," SAN FRANCISCO: Hundreds of workers from Google, Amazon and other technology companies on Friday (Sep 20) joined climate change marches in San Francisco and Seattle, saying their employers had been too slow to tackle global warming and needed to take more drastic action. While students set the global agenda and led local marches, US West Coast tech workers said they turned out in support and called on makers of software and hardware as well as providers of services such as cloud data storage to do more. The marches cap a week in which Alphabet Inc's Google said it had increased its wind and solar energy deals by more than 40 per cent, and Amazon.com Inc pledged to use only renewable energy by 2030. We're out on the streets because we want them to do more,"" said Danilo Quilaton, 34, a product designer for Amazon's video streaming subsidiary Twitch. He called Thursday's pledge by his company a big win. ""Amazon promised some things, but we still have to hold them liable,"" said Quilaton, who held a sign that read, ""I work at Amazon. I want zero deals with oil & gas"" companies. The number of people carrying signs referring to tech companies and shouting tech-related slogans on the streets of San Francisco and Seattle numbered in the hundreds or low thousands, a fraction of the tech workforce. But their presence was bigger than in past protests and represented a change in an industry whose engineers have often focussed on their work, rather than social issues. ""Amazon, let’s raise the bar not the temperature,"" read one protester's sign outside the glass domes at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle known as the Spheres, local symbols of the industry's wealth. ""Tech is having an awakening,"" said Google business analyst Marie Collins in San Francisco. ""Tech workers are realizing they have to take collective action."" One sign with the hashtag #techwontbuildit called for zero emissions by 2030, no deals to provide technology to oil and gas companies and zero corporate sponsorships of groups that deny climate change, echoing internal petitions at the big companies. The coordination across various companies paralleled recent joint efforts by staff to oppose work on military contracts, support immigrants and other issues. Tech workers by late morning joined youth-led marches, which filled a dozen blocks of San Francisco's Market Street. In Seattle, hundreds of tech workers gathered at Amazon's headquarters and marched to join bigger groups. The companies have signalled sympathy with workers on addressing climate change. But Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Thursday said it would be a bad idea to leave the cloud company's oil and gas customers with outdated tools as they are trying to evolve their businesses. ""HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE"" An Amazon spokeswoman on Friday said the company understands that some employees feel strongly about climate change and so does Amazon. Google, which on Thursday announced its clean energy deals, did not immediately return a request for comment. Though much of the public thinks of technology as a clean industry, unlike transportation or mainstream manufacturing, the employees said soaring electricity consumption for the data centres used in cloud computing was a major problem. “We are the ones who build the products,” said an organiser who asked to be identified only as Steven. “We are the ones who have the power to hold them accountable.”"""
Young climate strikers 'drop dead' at Thai environment ministry,20 Sep 2019 05:09PM (Updated: 20 Sep 2019 05:10PM),Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/young-climate-strikers-drop-dead-at-thai-environment-ministry-11927356," BANGKOK: More than 200 young people in Thailand stormed into the environment ministry on Friday (Sep 20) and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action on climate change along with thousands of strikers around the world. The young strikers were chanting Save our Earth"" as they marched into the government compound, before lying down on the ground to play dead. ""This is what will happen if we don't act on climate change now,"" said one of the strike leaders, Nanticha Ocharoenchai, 21. ""Today we are demanding that the Thai government declare a climate emergency and stop using fossil fuel.""   Young children were seen carrying coloured placards in one hand and holding a parent's hands in the other. One teenager also held a poster that read, ""The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend."" ""We're young, but we're not dumb. We know it's happening. We need change. We demand better,"" said activist Ralyn ""Lilly"" Satidtanasarn, 11, to cheering crowds. The Bangkok strike was part protests taking place in some 150 countries on Friday, inspired by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who urged students and others from around the world to speak in one voice about the impending effects of climate change on the planet. ""We're skipping school because teachers teach us how to work in the future, but if we don't do this, there will be no future for us to work in,"" said Peem Prasertsuntarasai, 11. Peem joined the strike with two schoolmates, Ari and Jay, holding placards featuring drawings of melting icebergs and power plants emitting dark smoke. ""So what's the point of studying in school if the world's gonna be gone?""

"Climate change takes toll on oceans, ice: UN report",20 Sep 2019 12:18PM (Updated: 20 Sep 2019 12:20PM),AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-takes-toll-on-oceans-ice-un-report-11925840," PARIS: Humanity should brace for blowback from oceans and frozen zones increasingly addled by climate change, a major UN report will warn. Loading the atmosphere with CO2 and greenhouse gases has spawned a host of consequences, starting with irreversible sea-level rise, according to a draft Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report obtained by AFP. Here are impacts highlighted in a summary slated for release on September 25: OCEANS WARMING SOAK IT UP: Oceans have absorbed a quarter of manmade greenhouse gases and 93 per cent of the extra heat they generate in the atmosphere. As a result, the world's seas have become warmer, more acidic and less salty. HEATWAVES: The frequency, intensity and extent of marine heatwaves like those that devastated Australia's Great Barrier Reef have all increased, with ocean hot spells twice as likely today as during the 1980s. EL NINOS: Extreme El Ninos - weather phenomena which drive forest fires, cause disease outbreaks and affect cyclones - are expected to double in frequency if emissions are not cut. SUSTENANCE: Food supply from shallow tropical waters could decline by 40 per cent by the year 2100 because of warming and acidification. Some ocean wildlife populations - from minuscule plankton to big fish and marine mammals - have shifted hundreds of kilometres toward their preferred temperatures, adversely affecting coastal fisheries. OCEANS RISING SEA LEVEL: Compared to the 1980-2000 period, seas will rise nearly half a metre by 2100 if Earth warms 2C above preindustrial levels, and 84 cm in a 3C-4C world. In the 22nd century, the pace of sea-level rise is likely to jump 100-fold from 3.6 millimetres per year today to several centimetres annually. Even if global warming is capped at 2C, oceans will eventually rise several metres, submerging areas that are today home to 280 million people. FLOOD DAMAGE: Without major adaptation efforts, the cost of annual flood damage caused by storm surges would increase 100- to 1,000-fold by 2100. ADAPTATION: Rising seas will force all coastal regions to adapt. Rich nations will more likely build barriers, developing ones will more likely be forced to retreat to higher ground. NEW NORMAL: Many low-lying megacities and small island states will experience what are today rare sea-level extremes every year by 2050, no matter how fast CO2 emissions are drawn down. WETLANDS: Globally, 20 to 90 percent of coastal wetlands will disappear by 2100, depending on sea-level rises. OCEANS DYING OXYGEN: The concentration of life-giving oxygen in marine environments has dropped two percent in 60 years, and will decline another three to four percent by 2100 at current rates of carbon pollution. Oxygen levels will likely decline over 59-80 per cent of the ocean surface within 20 years. DEAD ZONES: Coastal pollution and warming waters are creating vast oxygen-depleted dead zones. CORALS: Coral reefs - a major bulwark against storm surges - will decline by 90 per cent even in a 1.5 C world. Two degrees would be a death sentence for corals, which underpin the livelihoods of half a billion people today. ICE MELTING ICE SHEETS: Earth's two ice sheets, sitting atop Greenland and Antarctica, have shed on average more than 430 billion tonnes of mass each year since 2006, becoming the main drivers of sea-level rise. GLACIERS: Average annual runoff from glaciers in most mountain regions will have peaked and begun to decline by 2100. Worldwide, more than two billion people today depend on glaciers for fresh water. Low-altitude glaciers in the Alps, the Caucasus mountains and Scandinavia will lose more than 80 per cent of current mass by 2100. SNOW: Mountains will lose snow cover, with far-reaching impacts for agriculture, energy supply and tourism. PERMAFROST THAWING PERMAFROST: Thirty to 99 per cent of the world's top-layer permafrost - the top three metres - could melt by 2100 if carbon pollution continues unabated, releasing a carbon bomb of greenhouse gases. If emissions are aggressively capped, the area thawed could be vastly reduced. HEAVY METAL: Toxic mercury and other legacy contaminants"" in drinking water will increase with the melting of glaciers and permafrost, which may store nearly 800,000 tonnes of mercury - twice the amount found in all other environments combined."""
"Millions of young people, led by Sweden's Thunberg, to strike for climate action",20 Sep 2019 05:50AM (Updated: 20 Sep 2019 11:23AM),Reuters/de/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-strike-greta-thunberg-un-11925086," NEW YORK: With world leaders about to gather in New York for a UN Climate Action Summit next week, millions of young people from Australia to Iceland will take off from school or work on Friday (Sep 20) to demand urgent measures to stop environmental catastrophe. Protests, inspired by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, are planned in about 150 countries. The aim is for students and others from around the world to speak in one voice about the impending effects of climate change on the planet. Soon the sun will rise on Friday the 20th of September 2019. Good luck Australia, The Philippines, Japan and all the Pacific Islands. You go first!"" Thunberg posted on Instragram on Thursday. It’s early morning in the Pacific. Soon the sun will rise on Friday the 20th of September 2019. Good luck Australia, The Philippines, Japan and all the Pacific Island nations . You go first! Now lead the way! Happy striking! #fridaysforfuture #climatestrike #schoolstrike4climate (NZ along with many others go next week.) A post shared by Greta Thunberg (@gretathunberg) on Sep 19, 2019 at 1:24pm PDT  Thunberg has galvanised young people around the world since she started protesting alone with a sign outside the Swedish parliament building in August 2018. Over the past year, young people in other communities have staged scattered strikes in solidarity with her Fridays for Future movement. In conjunction with the UN summit this week, organisers on Friday will hold coordinated strikes around the world for a third time, with Thunberg spearheading a march and rally in New York, home of the United Nations headquarters. In a show of support, New York City education officials will excuse the absences of any of its 1.1 million public school students who want to participate. Demonstrators will gather in Lower Manhattan at noon and march about a mile to Battery Park at the edge of the financial district for a rally featuring speeches and music. Thunberg, who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in March, sailed to New York from England aboard a zero-carbon emissions vessel to partake in the UN summit. It brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels. Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say. Carbon emissions climbed a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate. Organisers said the demonstrations would take different forms, but all aim to promote awareness of climate change and demand political action to curb contributing factors to climate change, namely carbon emissions. Demonstrators in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa planned to dance on the beach in a celebratory pledge to protect their natural heritage. Protesters in Istanbul were heading to a public park for a climate festival with concerts and workshops scheduled throughout the day. On Wednesday, Thunberg appeared before several committees of US Congress to testify to the next generation's view on climate change. In lieu of testimony, she submitted a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that urged rapid, unprecedented changes in the way people live to keep temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030. ""I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action,"" she said."""
"Malaysia, Indonesia shut thousands of schools over haze",19 Sep 2019 03:39PM (Updated: 20 Sep 2019 10:48AM),AFP/cy,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/haze-malaysia-indonesia-schools-shut-air-quality-11921424," KUALA LUMPUR: Thousands of schools were shuttered across Malaysia and Indonesia on Thursday (Sep 19), affecting at least 1.7 million pupils, officials said, as toxic haze from rampant forest fires sent air quality plummeting. Nearly 2,500 schools were ordered to shut their doors in Malaysia - including nearly 300 in the smog-hit capital Kuala Lumpur - over soaring health concerns sparked by toxic haze from out-of-control blazes in Indonesia's Sumatra and Borneo islands. Indonesia said hundreds of schools in hard-hit Riau province on Sumatra would also be shut on Thursday, with 800 closed in one district alone, while about 1,300 were shut in its Central Kalimantan province on Borneo. The closures affected at least 1.7 million students in Malaysia. It was not clear how many pupils were forced to stay home in neighbouring Indonesia. Jakarta is deploying thousands of security forces and water-bombing aircraft to tackle the blazes, mostly started by illegal fires set to clear land for plantations. The fires belch smog across Southeast Asia annually, but this year's are the worst since 2015 and have added to concerns about wildfire outbreaks worldwide exacerbating global warming. Thursday's school shutdown marked the first mass closure in Kuala Lumpur as air quality deteriorated to unhealthy"" or ""very unhealthy"" levels on an official index in many parts of peninsular Malaysia, to the east of Sumatra, with the capital's skyline shrouded by dense smog. Malaysia's Sarawak state, on Borneo, was also smothered in toxic haze, as the fires hike diplomatic tensions. Borneo is divided between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. A growing number of Malaysians were suffering health problems due to the haze, with authorities saying there had been a sharp increase in outpatients at government hospitals - many suffering dry and itchy eyes. Poor visibility closed several airports in the Indonesian part of Borneo, and scores of flights have already been diverted and cancelled in the region in recent days due to the smog. Authorities have tried to induce rain through a technique called cloud seeding in a bid to extinguish the fires in Indonesia. But the onset of the rainy season, which usually starts in October, could be the only thing able to douse the blazes. Follow us on Telegram for the latest on the haze: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Fire and hail push insurers to rethink climate change risks,19 Sep 2019 02:27PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/fire-and-hail-push-insurers-to-rethink-climate-change-risks-11921316," LONDON: By the time David Kaisel got back from selling his flour at a farmers' market, a wildfire in California's Capay Valley had burnt both his tractor and the shipping container where he kept some tools. His insurer is set to pay out a sixth of his losses. He is now considering widening his coverage in the future to include fire insurance for his business. Kaisel is the kind of customer making insurers rethink their approach to climate change so they can sell policies without incurring too much risk. I’m already accustomed to drought, but in the past year I learned first-hand the consequences of both record rainfall and wildfire,"" Kaisel said. ""I’ll certainly consider insuring against environmental risks when my cash flow permits."" How much that should cost him is something insurers are getting to grips with after years in which their main natural catastrophe focus was hurricanes and earthquakes - and global warming was mainly a concern for the future rather than the present. Other natural disasters such as wildfires, flash floods and hail have become increasingly costly for the industry, even though they were traditionally seen as lesser risks and classed by some insurers as ""secondary perils"".   From 2010 to 2018, average insured losses from secondary perils were almost double those from primary perils such as earthquakes and hurricanes, a Reuters analysis of Swiss Re data showed. While scientists are wary of attributing particular disasters to climate change, most agree it is making extreme weather more frequent or intense. Insurers, along with Kaisel and other farmers around the world, are at the sharp end. ""A lot of the secondary perils are very localised, very short-term,"" said Thierry Corti, who heads climate change strategy for Swiss Re, which insures insurers. ""So we really need to understand them on a case-by-case basis and it's often very hard to generalise.""   In interviews, more than a dozen companies - including insurers, insurance associations, brokers and risk management firms - said these smaller disasters could be very costly. Some did not share specifics about how they were dealing with them but many did: several described details that had not been publicised before. HAZARD MAPS In response to needs of insurers and other customers, U.S. tech company ClimaCell said it began offering a wildfire prediction product this year, which analyses temperature, humidity and wind in real time. Allianz Re, the reinsurance arm of the German Allianz Group, started work on adding wildfires to an interactive hazard map at the end of last year after major wildfires in Portugal and California, Markus Stowasser, head of catastrophe research and development, said. The new version of the map, which already includes floods, tornadoes, hail, earthquakes, tropical and extra-tropical storms, is due to be launched this year. It will let Allianz underwriters assess the risk of wildfire anywhere in the world, based on previous wildfires, climate conditions and vegetation. Wildfires became a bigger focus for insurance companies after the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in Canada, said Dave Fox, chief executive of Geospatial Insight, a company that helps insurance companies assess damage from a catastrophe by collecting images and data. The Fort McMurray fire forced the evacuation of around 90,000 residents in northern Alberta and cut Canadian oil output by roughly 1 million barrels a day.   This year, Hiscox , an underwriter at Lloyd's of London, paid to licence a risk model for wildfires in the United States and applied its own research, after suffering losses from California wildfires in 2018. It will help Hiscox set premiums more accurately, said Shree Khare, head of catastrophe research, adding that it might have stopped insuring some clients in high-risk areas otherwise. ""Prior to this year we didn't really have a good modelling solution for U.S. wildfire,"" he said, adding that the industry wasn't paying much attention to wildfires before. ""I think it’s just the nature of insurance. We tend to worry about things after they happen."" While wildfires could become a bigger issue in Europe, he was not completely convinced and said losses would have to be larger before Hiscox would do similar modelling work there. RECORD LEVELS OF DESTRUCTION The California Department of Insurance regulator said in August coverage was getting harder to find for communities prone to wildfire, with a 10 per cent increase in insurers refusing to renew policies last year in areas that were affected by fires in 2015 and 2017. In May, the department said wildfire insurance losses from what it described as ""the most destructive wildfire month in California's history"" in November 2018 topped US$12 billion. Kaisel, who lost more than US$15,000 in the Capay Valley fires, expects to get US$2,500 from his insurer and managed to raise the rest via an online fundraiser. He would like to insure future risks once his five-year-old business growing specialised grains and milling them into flour starts making a profit - but the unpredictable impact of global warming means he is not sure exactly what the risks will be. ""For folks like me it's not some far off possibility, it's here and now,"" he said of climate change. ""It's happening.""   Swiss Re's research arm has published data going back to 1970 it said showed natural catastrophe losses from primary perils were being overtaken by those traditionally considered secondary. In August, it said the latter accounted for US$13 billion of US$15 billion in natural catastrophe insured losses in the first half of this year. It included standalone events - similar to the wildfire that forced the evacuation of 10,000 people in the Canary Islands last month and the tennis-ball-sized hail that caused damage in Munich in June. It also defined secondary perils as spinoffs from well-monitored primary perils, for example extra-heavy rainfall in Texas during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The data show total insured losses from natural catastrophes are up from less than US$7 billion a year in the 1970s to between US$29.3 billion and US$143.4 billion a year from 2010 to 2018. In 2018, 62 per cent of all natural catastrophe insurance claims came from secondary perils. Swiss Re's German rival Munich Re, said perils tended to evolve over time, citing flash-flooding as one that had moved up insurers' agenda, but agreed a change of emphasis was needed. In the past year, the reinsurer has focused more on drought as a driver of wildfire and has added a wildfire layer to one of its digital risk assessment tools, said Ernst Rauch, Munich Re's global head of climate and public sector business development. The new tool is available for California, Colorado, Arizona, British Columbia and Alberta and other regions will be added gradually over time. Zurich Insurance said it plans to refine the way it models the risk of floods to distinguish between a house at high risk of flooding and another 10 metres away that is less at risk. Its current model works with distances of around 100 metres. It is also hiring two people to work specifically on climate risks as part of the catastrophe research and development team. London insurance platform Lloyd's, whose member firms recorded a loss of 1 billion pounds (US$1.25 billion) last year driven by hurricanes, typhoons and wildfires, invited ClimaCell to join a ten-week innovation lab programme, which started this month. London-based insurer Beazley, said it was involved in another innovation programme run by Lloyd's and that it had already helped create new, specialised cover. But the process was not easy, Beazley said. ""These random events are very difficult to model and no one has done it before,"" said Beazley Chief Executive Andrew Horton. ""You only have to look at the Californian wildfires as an example."" Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at catastrophe risk modelling company Risk Management Solutions, said insurers tend to do the risk modelling after suffering big losses. ""It can be hard to convince the insurance sector that they need to do some modelling of something which they haven’t yet seen the impact of,"" he said. ""Modelling is expensive, it's going to take up time.""

China still planning new coal power projects: Environmental groups,19 Sep 2019 02:19PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-still-planning-new-coal-power-projects-environmental-11921220," SHANGHAI: China's total planned coal-fired power projects now stand at 226.2 gigawatts (GW), the highest in the world and more than twice the amount of new capacity on the books in India, according to data published by environmental groups on Thursday (Sep 19). The projects approved by China amount to nearly 40 per cent of the world's total planned coal-fired power plants, according to the Global Coal Exit List database run by German environmental organisation Urgewald and 30 other partner organisations. The new China projects would be more than Germany's existing installed power capacity of around 200 GW by the end of 2018. The environmental groups said in a press release on Thursday that worldwide, 400 of the 746 companies in their database were still planning to expand their coal operations. The companies include miners and power generators, and account for 89 per cent of the world's thermal coal production and nearly 87 per cent of the world's installed coal-fired power capacity. Of the total, 161 are Chinese. China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will be the focus of attention at next week's United Nations summit on climate action in New York, with Beijing promising more ambition when it comes to tackling global warming. China has been under pressure to curb investments in coal, at home and overseas, but Chinese financial institutions have continued to support coal projects. Beijing said on Tuesday, in a position paper ahead of the UN meeting, that it would remain on the clean energy and low-carbon development path"" but stopped short of setting new targets. China has cut the share of coal in its total energy mix from more than 68 per cent in 2012 to 59 per cent by the end of last year, but overall consumption has continued to increase. China had 1,160 GW of coal-fired power by the end of July, amounting to 62.8 per cent of the its total installed capacity. A Chinese industry group has suggested total capacity could eventually settle at 1,300 GW."""
Bangladesh rural poor bear financial burden of climate change: Study,19 Sep 2019 11:05AM (Updated: 19 Sep 2019 11:16AM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/bangladesh-rural-poor-climate-change-financial-impact-burden-11920746," DHAKA: Poor, rural Bangladeshis are spending far more than the government and aid agencies to combat the impact of climate change, diverting what little money they have away from basic needs, a study said on Thursday (Sep 19). Bangladesh - a densely populated and impoverished low-lying nation of 168 million people - is among the most vulnerable to global warming with rising sea levels threatening coastal villages. In a study billed as the first of its kind in comparing household spending to public financing, researchers found rural families were shelling out an average US$2 billion a year to address the impact of climate change. In contrast, Dhaka's budget for climate change in rural areas for 2018-2019 was US$1.46 billion, while international financing was an estimated US$154 million annually, the report by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) found. The report was released days before a UN Climate Action Summit in New York between governments, business leaders and international organisations. This research reveals an alarming imbalance,"" IIED's director Andrew Norton said in a statement. ""It is unacceptable that the poorest people are shouldering the burden of spending for adapting to climate change in Bangladesh. ""Much more needs to be done to make sure more public climate finance reaches the people who need it most."" Families - instead of buying food or spending their money on health and education - were repairing damaged homes and replacing animals and crops. They were using the money to raise their houses above flood levels, and some were even taking out high-interest loans from informal sources, pushing them further into poverty, the researchers said.   Mohammad Nannu's home was last year destroyed by the shifting currents of the Padma, a tributary of the Himalayan river the Ganges. He told AFP he borrowed money at an interest rate of more than 20 per cent to make ends meet after the disaster, which experts said was due to climate change. ""I become penniless after losing my home and property ... when the Padma devoured our entire village,"" the 50-year-old said. Local mayor Shahidul Islam said just a handful of families were provided with new homes, with hundreds of others having to rent or move to cities. Atiq Rahman, a Bangladeshi expert who sits in a UN climate change panel, welcomed the study but said US$2 billion was ""a fraction of the amount"" Bangladeshis and the government spent every year. ""This is an underestimate. There are many climate change-related costs that cannot be easily monetised,"" he told AFP, citing the impacts on health, land fertility and livestock."""
Melting snowcaps spell water trouble for world's highest capital,19 Sep 2019 10:47AM (Updated: 19 Sep 2019 10:51AM),AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/melting-snowcaps-spell-water-trouble-for-world-s-highest-capital-11920636," LA PAZ: Water resources are running dry in the world's highest-elevation capital due to the combined effect of the Andean glaciers melting, drought and mismanagement. But instead of surrendering, the locals in Bolivia's capital La Paz are finding new ways to tackle the changing climate. The sky-high metropolitan area's 2.7 million people have already been jolted by climate change: a severe drought that lasted for several months from 2016 into 2017 was Bolivia's worst in 25 years, leading to water rationing and widespread protests in several cities. In a sign of possibly worse to come, the Andean snowcaps - which have been relied on to fill the city's reservoirs - are disappearing at a rate that has alarmed scientists. In a gray and misty Valle de las Flores district in the east of the city, people are beginning to adapt to disappearing water resources. There, Juana and her colleague Maria wash clothes for a living at a municipal wash-house, which is fed by spring water. Public wash-houses - where the water is free - are becoming more popular, as residents change their habits around water use, getting their laundry done and escaping rising water charges. It's true that there are more people coming here than ever before,"" since water started to become more scarce, said Juana, as the women scrubbed and wrung-out garments for a fee of 20 bolivianos, or around US$3 per dozen items.   In some neighborhoods, locals have become accustomed to storing rainwater in cisterns, ready for when the dry season comes. The severe drought that lasted from November 2016 to February 2017 was blamed on the combined effects of the El Nino weather cycle, poor water management and climate change. Leftist President Evo Morales declared a ""state of national emergency"" and tens of thousands of people in La Paz faced imposed water rationing for the first time, while surrounding mountains that were once covered in snow turned brown and barren. The measures were expanded to at least seven other cities, and in the countryside, farmers clashed with miners over the use of aquifers. DISAPPEARING GLACIERS As part of a contingency plan, Morales doubled down by embarking on a vast investment program in a bid to ensure future water supplies. According to recent data from the national water company EPSAS, the government has spent US$64.7 million to construct four water reservoirs and supply systems from the lagoons of the surrounding Andean highlands. The new systems will in part ease reliance on the Inkachaka, Ajunkota and Hampaturi dams that have until now supplied drinking water to around one-third of La Paz's population. The drought had left the dams almost completely depleted, resembling open-cast mines, and they took months to recover ample water levels. Patricia Urquieta, an urban planning specialist at the University Mayor de San Andres, says that despite the hardships it brought, the drought did not lead to an increased collective awareness of the need to manage water resources. Once water restrictions were lifted ""this awareness of the need to preserve water fizzled out,"" said Urquieta. ""There has been no public policy to raise awareness about water usage, even though reports show that La Paz could end up without water because of the decrease of water in the mountains,"" she said. UNESCO introduced an ""Atlas on the retreat of Andean glaciers and the reduction of glacial waters"" to map the effects of global warming in 2018.   It said ""global warming could cause the loss of 95 per cent of the current permafrost in Bolivia by 2050, and 99 per cent by 2099."" A recent study published in the scientific journal Nature, citing analysis of satellite images, reported that ""the Andean glaciers are among those that shrink the fastest"". Between 2000 and 2018, the glaciers lost an average of 23 billion tonnes of ice a year, according to Nature ""When the glaciers disappear, they will no longer be able to provide water during the dry season,"" said Sebastien Hardy, who is studying the local glaciers for the French Institute for Research and Development. The Chacaltaya glacier - once the world's highest ski resort - has already disappeared. Scientists said the glacier started to melt in the mid-1980s. By 2009, it had vanished. The Inkachaka dam, a few miles outside the La Paz, is currently more than half-full, fed by snowfalls during the austral winter. But the year-round snowcaps on nearby mountains, visible as recently as 30 years ago, no longer exist."""
Youth climate activists to join Sweden's Thunberg in protest at US Supreme Court,18 Sep 2019 07:42PM,Reuters/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/youth-climate-activists-to-join-sweden-s-thunberg-in-protest-at-us-supreme-court-11918236," WASHINGTON: Seven young Americans who have sued the US government for failing to take action on climate change will join Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg on the steps of the Supreme Court on Wednesday to urge political leaders and lawmakers to support their legal fight and take action to phase out the use of fossil fuels. In the 2015 lawsuit, 21 activists, ages 11 to 22, said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the US Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out, and it is currently under consideration in a federal appeals court in Oregon. What we're pushing for ... based on decades of climate science coming out is that we have to limit (the global temperature rise) to 1 degree Celsius,"" said Nathan Baring, a plaintiff in the climate case known as Juliana vs. the United States. The Paris Climate Agreement aims to limit the global average temperature increase to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Current policies put the world on track for a rise of at least 3 degrees Celsius by century’s end, and scientists say more aggressive action is needed. Further warming could push the climate system closer to irreversible tipping points, scientists warn, raising the risk of harvest failures, forced migration, mass extinction of species, ecosystem collapse and societal breakdown. The Trump administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy. Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, told a group of youth climate activists including some of the Juliana plaintiffs on Tuesday that the court case is crucial for the country to be able to go after fossil fuel companies. ""I appreciate the importance of your case,"" he said. ""The courts are where this issue does belong. That's where we will get at the truth."" Thunberg, the Juliana plaintiffs and other youth activists will also spend time on Capitol Hill on Wednesday at a hearing of a House foreign affairs panel. Thunberg is due to address lawmakers late on Wednesday."""
"Tree-planting not cure-all solution for carbon emission, say activists",18 Sep 2019 10:08AM (Updated: 18 Sep 2019 10:10AM),AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/tree-planting-not-cure-all-solution-for-carbon-emission-say-11915802," PARIS: A few euros, a couple of mouse clicks and a tree is planted - as air travel is increasingly becoming a source of guilt, consumers and companies are looking for other ways to ease their conscience and reduce their carbon footprint. But as more polluting industries join efforts to offset their carbon emissions, the effectiveness of the approach is open to debate, with some critics suggesting that tree-planting schemes are nothing more than a fig leaf. Once marginal, the offset movement has even reached the arch-enemy of environmentalists: big oil. Shell has ploughed US$300 million into forest plantations to reduce its carbon footprint by 2-3 per cent, Italy's ENI has set an objective of zero net emissions via its forestry investments, and France's Total plans to set up a special business unit"" next year to spend US$100 million annually on compensation efforts. Beyond the grand statements, carbon offset schemes basically follow the same, simple mechanism. A polluting company or individual purchases a credit equivalent to a tonne of carbon dioxide and the purchase price is paid directly or indirectly into an emissions reduction scheme, such as planting trees which absorb CO2 responsible for global warming or investment in renewable energy sources. This is the principle that the civil aviation industry is adopting with its initiative CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) starting from 2020. Sixty-five countries have signed up to it so far - equivalent to 87 per cent of all international activity in the sector. ""There will be a number of eligible carbon reduction schemes and airlines will be able to buy the equivalent tonnes of CO2 via these projects,"" says Nathalie Simmenauer, Air France's head of environment and sustainable development. The aim is to reach ""neutral carbon growth"" - that is to ensure future emissions are held at 2020 levels. ""A COP-OUT"" While trees are an important tool for regulating the climate, reforestation alone cannot whitewash a company's carbon-emitting activity, say activists. ""If you don't reduce your emissions and don't stop deforestation, you're not going to solve anything by merely planting trees,"" says Stephane Hallaire, president and founder of Reforest'Action, which has planted 3.8 million trees in nine years. For just three euros, the company will plant a tree adapted to the local biodiversity and purchase part of a carbon credit for a foreign forest conservation project. But Hallaire argues that reforestation must also be accompanied by better behaviour elsewhere. Jean-Francois Rial, the head of the environmentally friendly tour operator, Voyageurs du Monde, agrees. He fervently advocates so-called ""absorption"", where ""precise and sustainable"" reforestation projects are identified and financed without the use of carbon credit systems, which are seen by some as more opaque and less effective. ""It's a cop-out that risks dissuading society collectively from making greater effort and investing in costlier technologies,"" says Alain Karsenty, researcher at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD). Large-scale reforestation also poses other problems: the planted trees may compete with local cultures and forests and may not necessarily be beneficial to the local environment. ""These are often fast-growing species such as eucalyptus, pines, because we need trees that store carbon very quickly, but it can end up causing problems of biodiversity, soil drying,"" Karsenty said. Reforestation alone is ""insufficient"", but still ""better than nothing"", and, for the time being it is just one tool among others to reduce emissions, the expert says. That is until technological advances that allow the efficient capturing and storage of CO2 from the air or developing jets that run on hydrogen. ""It at least lets you buy time. Temporary storage can be a way to make the transition while waiting for breakthrough technologies,"" says Karsenty."""
Swedish activist Thunberg joins other teens on Capitol Hill to urge climate action,18 Sep 2019 12:19AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/swedish-activist-thunberg-joins-other-teens-on-capitol-hill-to-urge-climate-action-11914806," WASHINGTON: Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg joined other youth leaders to urge US lawmakers to support “transformative climate action” during two days of meetings and speeches on Capitol Hill, starting on Tuesday (Sep 17). The events are intended to drum up support ahead of a global “climate strike” on Friday in which students and workers around the world will walk out to demand more action to fight global warming and pressure leaders attending the annual United Nations summit in New York later this month. Democratic Senator Ed Markey, chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force, hosted a news conference kicking off the meetings with the activists on Tuesday morning, before including them at the task force’s weekly meeting to discuss their intergenerational"" effort to combat climate change.   ""This movement is something that comes at a critical time,"" Markey said outside the Capitol building. ""The science has made it very clear that the planet is running out of time."" Thunberg had no plans to speak at Tuesday’s events, a spokesperson said. Thunberg shot to international fame last year when she started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden’s parliament for action on climate change. She was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year after the number of students joining her strikes - dubbed “Fridays for Future” - broke two million across 135 countries. In the United States, organizers of the planned Sep 20 strike have put forward a list of eight demands on elected officials, including enacting a Green New Deal - an effort to transform the US economy in a decade by shifting to 100 per cent renewable energy. Markey is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal congressional resolution with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a high-profile New York Democrat who plans to meet with the activists this week. Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have pilloried the Green New Deal as fantasy. Trump is among a small minority of global leaders who have openly questioned the science of climate change. He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, a global pact to stem the rise in global temperatures that he says would be damaging to the US economy. Nadia Nazar, co-founder the Zero Hour advocacy group and a youth activist speaker, said Friday's global strike would usher in ""the beginning of the Green New Deal."" ""The generation of the Green New Deal will not only survive but we will thrive. We will no longer be known as the kids fighting the apocalypse. We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis,"" she said."""
"Earth to warm more quickly, new climate models show",17 Sep 2019 03:52PM (Updated: 17 Sep 2019 04:00PM),AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/earth-warm-more-quickly-new-climate-change-models-show-11913424," PARIS: Greenhouse gases thrust into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels are warming Earth's surface more quickly than previously understood, according to new climate models set to replace those used in current UN projections, scientists said Tuesday (Sep 17). By 2100, average temperatures could rise 6.5 to 7.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels if carbon emissions continue unabated, separate models from two leading research centres in France showed. That is up to two degrees higher than the equivalent scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's (IPCC) 2014 benchmark 5th Assessment Report. The new calculations also suggest the Paris Agreement goals of capping global warming at well below"" two degrees, and 1.5C if possible, will be harder to reach, the scientists said. ""With our two models, we see that the scenario known as SSP1 2.6 - which normally allows us to stay under 2C - doesn't quite get us there,"" Olivier Boucher, head of the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Modelling Centre in Paris, told AFP. With barely one degree Celsius of warming so far, the world is already coping with increasingly deadly heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones made more destructive by rising seas. A new generation of 30-odd climate models known collectively as CMIP6 - including the two unveiled Tuesday - will underpin the IPCC's next major report in 2021. ""CMIP6 clearly includes the latest modelling improvements,"" even as important uncertainties remain, Joeri Rogelj, an associate professor at Imperial College London and an IPCC lead author, told AFP. These include increased supercomputing power and sharper representations of weather systems, natural and man-made particles, and how clouds evolve in a warming world. ""We have better models now,"" said Boucher. ""They have better resolution, and they represent current climate trends more accurately."" ""TIPPING POINTS"" A core finding of the new models is that increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will warm Earth's surface more easily than earlier calculations had suggested. If confirmed, this higher ""equilibrium climate sensitivity"", or ECS, means humanity's carbon budget - our total emissions allowance - is likely to shrink. The French models are among the first to be released, but others developed independently have come to the same unsettling conclusion, Boucher confirmed. ""The most respected ones - from the United States, and Britain's Met Office - also show a higher ECS"" than the previous generation of models, he said. This is bad news for fight against global warming, which continues to face strong political headwinds and institutional inertia despite a rapid crescendo of public awareness and concern. ""A higher ECS means a greater likelihood of reaching higher levels of global warming, even with deeper emissions cuts,"" Boucher and two British scientists - Stephen Belcher from the UK Met Office and Rowan Sutton from the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science - wrote in a blog earlier this year, tiptoeing around the implications of the new models. ""Higher warming would allow less time to adapt and mean a greater likelihood of passing climate 'tipping points' such as thawing of permafrost, which would further accelerate warming."" A third to 99 per cent of top-layer permafrost could melt by 2100 if carbon pollution is not abated, releasing billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the air, according to a draft IPCC special report on oceans and Earth's frozen zones obtained by AFP. ""Unfortunately, our global failure to implement meaningful action on climate change over recent decades has put us in a situation where what we need to do to keep warming to safe levels is extremely simple,"" said Rogelj. ""Global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline today rather than tomorrow, and global CO2 emissions should be brought to net zero."" The 2014 basket of climate models show Earth warming on current trends an additional 3C by 2100, and at least 2C even if national carbon cutting pledges are all met. The two French climate models, including one from France's National Centre for Meteorological Research (CNRM), were to be unveiled at a press conference in Paris."""
Subterranean blaze: Indonesia struggles to douse undergound fires,,AFP/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/haze-indonesia-fire-struggles-to-douse-underground-blaze-11909946," PEKANBARU, Indonesia: Thousands of Indonesian firefighters are locked in an around-the-clock game of Whack-a-Mole as they battle to extinguish an invisible enemy - underground fires that aggravate global warming. Vast blazes are ripping across the archipelago's rainforests, unleashing a toxic haze over Southeast Asia that has triggered health fears and sent diplomatic tensions with Indonesia's neighbours soaring. Jakarta deployed more than 9,000 personnel to battle fires turning land into charred landscapes and consuming forests in hard-hit Sumatra and Borneo island. But many of the blazes smoulder deep underground in once-swampy areas known as peatlands, where they can last for months and release eye-watering amounts of thick, acrid smoke. It's so much harder to fight fires on peatlands,"" a dirty and exhausted Hendri Kusnardi told AFP outside smog-hit Pekanbaru city in Sumatra. ""Even after we've managed to put out a fire on the ground, sometimes it is not over because it's still burning underground. And then the next morning the ground fire will just reignite."" ""HUMAN BEHAVIOUR"" The culprit behind Indonesia's blazes is usually illegal fires set to clear land for the lucrative palm oil and pulpwood industries - and the situation this year has been worsened by drier weather. Some of the most serious fires happen in carbon-rich peatlands - topped with layers of decomposed plant material several metres thick - which become highly combustible when they're drained of water to be converted into plantations.   ""The forest and peatland fires that occur every year are a crisis created by human behaviour,"" said Rusmadya Maharuddin, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. ""Sometimes the fires will continue to burn for months, releasing emissions and causing haze.""   Peat fires can belch out three times as much smoke per kilogramme of material than high-temperature forest fires, she added. At the peak of Indonesia's 2015 forest fires - the country's worst in two decades - blazes in peat swamp forests emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of carbon emissions daily, more than the entire US economy in the same period, according to watchdog The International Union for Conservation of Nature. Across the Pacific Ocean, huge fires tearing through the Amazon are compounding concerns about the long-term impact, as increasing fire outbreaks globally creates more greenhouse gas emissions and makes it harder to limit temperature rises, experts say. DETECTION DRAWBACK Fighting peatland fires comes with myriad challenges because they're often in remote locations, the soft soil makes them inaccessible by car and firefighters need huge amounts of water - often pumped below ground - to get at subterranean blazes. Indonesia has deployed water-bombing helicopters, but the onset of the rainy season, which usually starts in October, could be the only thing able to douse the fires. ""When you're dealing with large areas of peat burning it's just so expensive to bring in large quantities of water,"" said Michael Brady, an Indonesia-based peatlands expert at the Center for International Forestry Research. ""Water-bombing is not very effective because you just can't drop enough water"" to douse them, he added. Satellite radar used to find hotspots - areas of intense heat which indicate a high chance of fire - does not always pinpoint below-ground blazes. ""It may not show up as a hotspot ... (because) there might not be enough heat at the surface of the ground,"" Brady said. ""So, one of the challenges is just to detect them.""   ""NOT GOING AWAY"" Authorities are beefing up law enforcement to catch those responsible for illegal burning and have moved to restore degraded peatland forests - a key buffer against annual flooding and home to endangered species, including Sumatran orangutans. But despite Indonesia's progress over the past few decades, fighting fires is still a challenge even for countries like the United States, Canada and Australia which have some of the top technologies and fire prevention programmes, Brady said. ""This is not going to go away,"" he added. ""We're not going to find a solution to eliminate fires on the landscape completely and we're not going to 'tackle' it. This requires an ongoing investment."" Follow us on Telegram for the latest on the haze: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
12-year-old Lilly wages 'war' on plastic in Thailand,,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/12-year-old-lilly-wages-war-on-plastic-in-thailand-11909256," BANGKOK: Skipping school to glide through a dirty Bangkok canal on a paddleboard, Lilly fishes out rubbish in her mission to clean up Thailand, where the average person uses eight plastic bags every single day. I am a kid at war,"" the bubbly 12-year-old says after a painstaking hour-long routine picking up cans, bags and bottles bobbing in the canal. ""I try to stay optimistic but I am also angry. Our world is disappearing,"" she adds. Thailand is the sixth largest global contributor to ocean pollution, and plastic is a scourge. Whether it's for wrapping up street food, takeaway coffees or for groceries, Thais use 3,000 single use bags per year - 12 times more than someone from the European Union. In June, Lilly won her first victory: she persuaded Central, a major supermarket in Bangkok, to stop giving out plastic bags in its stores once a week. ""I told myself that if the government did not listen to me, it would be necessary to speak directly to those who distribute plastic bags and convince them to stop,"" she explains.   This month some of the biggest brands, including the operator of the ubiquitous 7-Eleven convenience stores, pledged to stop handing out single-use plastic bags by January next year. Mindsets have started to shift this year with the deaths of several marine mammals whose stomachs were lined with plastic, stirring emotions. The demise last month of a baby dugong was mourned on social media, reviving discussion in the government over a proposed ban on most single-use plastics by 2022. But critics say along with new rules there need to be enforcement mechanisms such as fines. For now young activists like Lilly can help capture attention. ""You might be able to tune out all of the evidence and advocacy in the world, but it's very hard to ignore a child when they ask why we're trashing the planet that they have to live on,"" says Kakuko Nagatani-Yoshida, regional coordinator for chemicals, waste and air quality with UN Environment. ""IT'S UP TO US"" Lilly is Ralyn Satidtanasarn's nickname. The US-Thai youngster started campaigning at the age of eight after a seaside vacation in southern Thailand where she was horrified by a beach covered in rubbish. ""We cleaned up with my parents, but that was not helpful because other waste was thrown out by the sea the next day,"" she recalls. Then came the global movement initiated by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who has become a key face in the battle against global warming. Inspired by the young Swede, Lilly did sit-ins in front of the Thai government buildings. ""Greta Thunberg gave me confidence. When adults do not do anything, it's up to us children to act,"" she insists. Though she often skips class to carry out her activism, she will not be in New York alongside Thunberg for a protest on September 20 just days before the UN climate conference. ""My place is here, the fight is also in Southeast Asia,"" she says. Even if she sometimes wants to take a break and ""go play"" like other kids, she also takes part in cleaning sessions organised by local association Trash Hero. Other activists praise her but say she is up against massive corporate interests. The main obstacle is the petrochemical industry, one of the main markets for plastics, accounting for 5 per cent of Thailand's GDP and tens of thousands of jobs. ""Lilly is a very good voice for the youth of this country but the lobbies are very powerful and that makes any change difficult,"" concedes Nattapong Nithiuthai, who set up a company turning discarded waste into flip flops. She can also count on the support of her parents, who help her write speeches to the UN and government officials. Her mother, Sasie, herself a former environmental activist, adds: ""At first, I thought it was a child's fad, but Lilly hung on, so I decided to support her."""""
Tides of change: Palau calls on ‘big brothers and sisters’ in the global effort against climate change,14 Sep 2019 06:30AM (Updated: 16 Sep 2019 04:52PM),CNA/mt,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/climate-change-special/tides-of-change-palau-climate-change-global-effort-11900388," KOROR, Palau: Undiscriminating, unrelenting, unstoppable. It slices through swathes of land, carves out crevices, and finds only weakness. It hammers on doors, cleans out homes, and finds only loss. “(Typhoon) Bopha brought very strong wind,” recalled Palau resident Isabella Yano of the 2012 storm. “The water flowed under our house as we had elevated it with posts. But underneath it, we had put washer, dryer and freezer… They floated away.” Facing the force of the category five super typhoon, others were not so lucky. “Because their houses were near the water, some broke (apart) and some floated away,” Mdm Yano added. “We were also scared of the sea because the tide is always coming up ... The sea water (was) coming up so we plan to move our house up here.” Less than a year later, Typhoon Bopha was followed by Typhoon Haiyan - which ravaged other parts of Palau. Unlike some of its neighbours, Palau lies outside the typhoon zone, meaning it is supposed to bear less of the brunt of such storms. But with the increasing ferocity of these typhoons coupled with rising sea levels and increasing ocean temperatures, it is clear the island nation now stands on the frontline of climate change, said President Tommy Remengesau.   And he is calling on others to join the battle. “To solve the problem, it cannot be an individual effort, it's got to be a collective worldwide effort, international effort and it's got to be solved by the people who contribute the most to the problem,” he explained. “We hope that the big brothers and sisters of the developed countries of the world will see that this is something that is a responsibility on all of us and everyone should do their part.” What happens on the other side of the globe has serious consequences for Palau, said the country's ambassador to the United Nations Ngedikes Uludong, who is also the country's envoy for climate change.   “When you’re talking about climate change in a global context, just because we’re small and we’re here doesn’t mean that we don’t feel the impacts from the other side of the world,” she said. “So if you’re producing high carbon emissions on the other side of the world … on this side of the world, we feel the impact. So it behooves us to encourage the international community to take it seriously.” TACKLING A ‘MORAL’ ISSUE Palau is punching above its weight when it comes to tackling climate change. Just three years ago, it became one of the first nations in the world to ratify the Paris climate agreement. The agreement aims to limit the global temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.   The United States has since withdrawn from the pact, while Russia is yet to formally ratify it despite being one of the 197 countries who signed the agreement. Said Mr Remengesau: “The developed nations of the world who contribute greatly to what causes climate change or what causes global warming, they need to look at this as a moral issue, as a world sustainable issue and really at least stick to the targets enunciated by the Paris Agreement. “Even the Paris Agreement like you know, scientists have said that it doesn't go far enough but at least it's a start.” There has also been a concerted switch towards the use of clean energy as the island nation aims to generate 45 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2025.   “We're definitely promoting renewable energy - even though we contribute the least to the causes of climate change,” said Mr Remengesau. “We hope that by doing so, our developed partners at least understand that we're doing something in a small scale but we're addressing the very problem that developed countries are contributing to the emissions of harmful gases in the atmosphere.”  The island nation has also been active in conservation - setting up the world’s first national shark sanctuary a decade ago and in 2015, designating 80 per cent of its maritime territory as a fully protected marine reserve where activities such as fishing are not allowed to take place. SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY In the meantime, Palau has to come to grips with an unfamiliar reality.   This has seen shifts in the weather and seasons, said Palau’s minister of natural resources, environment and tourism Mr F. Umiich Sengebau. “Fishermen understand the calendar that there are two seasons - basically, you have six months of easterly winds and six months of winds coming from the west,” he explained. “That’s not very predictable nowadays … That unpredictability is certainly having an impact on the environment, so what the fishermen know in terms of seasons for fish and whatnot has also eroded over the years. When you ask them when’s a good time to harvest these fish, they say: ‘We don’t know anymore’” For those involved in agriculture, there is now less of a delineation between planting and harvesting seasons. “It’s changing ecosystems to the point where the traditional knowledge will become less and less relevant,” added Mr Xavier Matsutaro, head of Palau’s office of climate change. And with the threat of intensified typhoons, the Palauan government has its work cut out. “The typhoon impact is devastating because it kills the corals and destroys the structures. It flattens everything and it takes everything,” explained chief executive officer of the Palau International Coral Reef Centre Dr Yimnang Golbuu.   “The prediction is not that we’ll get more typhoons but we’ll have more intense extreme events.” “We used to be proud that we were outside of the typhoon belt - sometimes we were accused of ‘manufacturing’ storms and sending them off to other places because we were really not affected,” added Mr Remengesau. “Now we are getting our own share of natural disasters and natural storms. And that's not a good thing, because one storm can negate or can destroy whatever investments we've built upon and all the resources we have dispersed ... So when we do our national budgets now, we automatically set aside funds for a rainy day, literally. Palau is also working with the Asian Development Bank to set aside funds which would be available to be withdrawn immediately, should a storm hit. Said Mr Remengesau: “We're preparing ourselves for those kinds of scenarios, but again, one storm can wipe out everything so we're always keeping our fingers crossed.” For now, the Palauan population has remained resilient. “Most of the people live in the coastal parts of the urban area in Palau … that’s their daily life - they move their tables, they move their couches,” said Ms Uludong. “The impacts have increased and … the community is very resilient in living with it.” Take Mdm Yano, who moved to higher ground in the village of Ngiwal three months after the 2012 storm. But even now, she is regularly reminded that she is never too far from the water. The retired schoolteacher has a number of taro patches which are flooded by sea water during particularly extreme high tides.   And when the tides rise, the taros die. Mdm Yano now resorts to using parts of a corrugated tin roof to block the incoming tide. “I have another taro patch close to the sea so when the tide is high, it all comes inside,” she added. “That one is a very open place, so it’s a bigger problem. There’s a beach and the water is coming in ... I’m just going (to have to) leave it.” Clearly, the tentacles of the tide are never too far away. And so the message to the world is as clear as the unspoiled waters off Palau’s coasts. “In every opportunity in an international arena, we want to tell the world this is impacting (us), this is close to home,” said Mr Sengebau. Echoed Mr Remengesau: “We are on the frontline and if we don't do something to stop the problem, eventually the frontline will extend to other people and that's the sad part. It's going to involve more and more (of the) world's population. “We've gone past the time of debating or describing the problem, it's really time to stop the problem, not continue to describe it.”"""
"Tides of change: As fish and coral disappear, Palau faces the economic realities of climate change",14 Sep 2019 06:30AM (Updated: 15 Sep 2019 09:17AM),CNA/mt,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/climate-change-special/tides-of-change-as-fish-and-coral-disappear-palau-faces-the-11900216," BABELDAOB, Palau: The placid Pacific shimmers on the horizon. For centuries, this vast expanse of water has been occasionally blustery, usually blue, always bountiful. But the days of its benevolence have slowly slipped away. And so too has some of its marine life. “The species (of fish) are still the same, but the numbers are getting really low … When I go fishing, I don’t see schools of fish, just a few,” reflected part-time fisherman Junior Leeroy, who has made a living from the water for over three decades. Leeroy and others who catch fish for a living say they know why.   “The corals are dying, you can see it. The fish don’t like to stay in the dead coral - they look for the live coral and go to another area,” he explained. “I think it’s because of climate change, that’s the reason - I truly believe that. With hundreds of islands blanketed in thick green sitting in the clear ocean waters, Palau, a three-hour flight from the Philippines' capital of Manila, seems a postcard-perfect paradise. But the looming spectre of climate change could change all that, its president Tommy Remengesau told CNA. “Climate change is really the biggest threat to our food security, our economic security, our cultural and social way of life and the security that we enjoy as island people,” he said. “It's a phenomenon that is real, (and) unfortunately it is affecting the source of food, which is our ocean.""  ""WE SIT DOWN AND SHAKE OUR HEADS"" According to 2019 data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Palau’s nominal GDP for the 2016 - 2017 financial year was approximately US$290 million (S$400 million). Within the same year, tourism receipts totalled US$115.8 million. Tourism activities have been responsible for about three-quarters of Palau’s economic growth, said a 2014 IMF report, with more than 40 per cent of total employment in Palau coming from tourism-related activities. The country typically sees at least 100,000 visitors a year, said government data - more than five times the local population. When it comes to fisheries, UN data states that the contribution of fisheries to the GDP in 2014 was 2.2 per cent of the national GDP.   The president said that climate change is changing the terrestrial landscapes of Palau - and the things that help drive the economy: ""We have noticed a very drastic change of patterns - drastic change of weather, drastic change of sea level rise, drastic change in the ocean temperature which results in coral bleaching and hence the overall fish population - where they migrate and how they breed."" According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, oceans have absorbed more than 90 per cent of the excess heat produced between 1971 to 2010. This warmth is understood to be trapped by greenhouse gases. For Palau, which boasts breathtaking biodiversity in its marine ecosystems, this spells trouble. Take coral bleaching, where warmer water causes coral to expel the algae living in their tissues. This could result in the death of the coral, putting at risk the delicate ecosystem of marine life in the surrounding waters that relies on it. “We are near the tropics - right about the equator. We have a very narrow range of temperatures and so the corals are used to living in that temperature. So even if it is one or 1.5 degrees (celsius) higher …. corals start to bleach,” explained chief executive officer of the Palau International Coral Reef Centre Dr Yimnang Golbuu.   ""This increase in temperature is a big issue that we are facing and the models and the predictions are that the bleaching events will become more intense and more frequent ... If we have more frequent bleaching events, then that would be harder for the reefs to recover - it’s not enough (time) to recover.” With the destruction of this natural habitat comes the loss of marine life, added Palau’s minister of natural resources, environment and tourism Mr F. Umiich Sengebau. “In the last twenty years, we could go and catch a lot of fish but right now that’s something that we sit down and shake our heads about - what’s going on here?” he said. “A lot of what’s contributing to the fisheries decline is the (lack of) habitat, and that is caused by climate change. And when you don’t have that habitat, you don’t have its residents there. “Next time you dive into the crystal blue water, there may be no fish or no corals.” Recognising the need for conservation, Palau has been proactive.   In 2009, it set up the world’s first national shark sanctuary, putting an end to all commercial shark fishing within its waters. Six years later, it designated 80 per cent of its maritime territory as a fully protected marine reserve where activities such as fishing are not allowed to take place. Local fishermen will be able to fish in the remaining area. At 500,000 sq km, or slightly larger than the US state of California, the sanctuary is being phased in over five years, and will become the sixth-largest fully protected marine area in the world. This move has been widely supported, as locals understand its long term implications, said Mr Sengebau. “Fishermen understand that these kinds of areas are important for us to withstand the kind of impact that we are facing on a global scale,” he said. “We have had studies that have showed that in areas that are protected, we are seeing five times more fish, so that's really helping to repopulate those areas that are open for fishermen to fish.” ‘THE ENVIRONMENT IS OUR ECONOMY’ A soft breeze ripples through the trees, rustling the floral tablecloth anchored by woven baskets bearing a traditional Palauan spread. Strains of guitar and harmonica accompany the chatter of excited conversations as a group of visitors to Palau tuck in. This is the new face of tourism in the island nation, and climate change has had a part to play in its formation.   “When tourism started in Palau, it was started by divers and Palau if you’re a diver – it’s a bucket list, it’s one of the places you want to dive,” explained Mr Ngiraibelas Tmetuchl, chairman of the Palau Visitors Authority. “So when the market or tourism started growing, it grew around diving.” But with Palau’s reefs and ecosystem becoming increasingly affected, there was a need for an alternative option for intrepid travellers - community-based tourism.  Said Mr Tmetuchl: “That concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket came into play. So, what we’re doing now is that we’re moving inland and into the villages. We’re creating lunches like this one and we’re rotating it around so everybody gets a chance to get an overspill of tourism benefits. “And at the same time we’re creating experiences not related to the water, and in the event something does happen to the water, we’ve got a plan B.” Take Jellyfish Lake, which is a tourist hotspot nestled in Palau’s Rock Islands. There, visitors can snorkel with thousands upon thousands of harmless jellyfish. A El Nino weather event followed by a drought in 2016 devastated the jellyfish in the lake. It was officially shut in May 2017, though tour operators and local villagers took the initiative to close it a year earlier.   “A lot of tourists come to Palau because this is one of the unique things that we have,” explained Dr Golbuu. “Once they died, the tourists didn’t go to those sites because there was nothing to see and so the economy lost millions of dollars. “That just shows the impact that climate change has on the economy and the impact on people.” In the words of Mr Remengesau, the tourism industry is “the mother goose that lays the golden eggs”. He explained: “For our tourism industry, people come to Palau because of the serenity of the water, the tremendous biodiversity we have. So anytime you see coral bleaching, anytime you see the fish population declining because the habitat is being destroyed - it concerns you, because that’s the industry that you want to protect and promote. “We're always saying that the environment is our economy and the economy is our environment. They are inseparable and in that way we are very concerned because if climate change destroys our number one asset, then there goes our industry.” Thus, the one year old programme gives tourists the chance to visit local villages, experience local culture and sample local food. But as with fish stocks, there are constant reminders that the effects of climate change are never too far away. Take the taro plant, an important staple for locals. Taro patches close to the sea in Palau have been regularly inundated by sea water. “The climate change experience we’ve had is that marshland where we grew our taro is now being inundated by ocean,” said Mr Tmetuchl. “That is affecting what food crop we can produce for these experiences. Some (people) are building sea walls, some of them are looking at how they can transplant and move their farms upward. This is recent, probably lasting ten years (but) it has gotten worse in the past five. “There were never any issues (in the past).""   But locals remain hopeful to adapt and overcome. At the coral reef centre, Dr Golbuu is also hard at work. Along with partners from Stanford University in the US and Newcastle University in the UK, his team have begun research to identify coral able to survive in warmer waters and to study if they can be bred. It is a ""band-aid"" to a much bigger problem, but he is determined to do his part. ""I'm not one of those who think it doesn’t matter what you do because everything is going to be destroyed,"" Dr Golbuu said. ""I believe that these are big issues but there’s research that we need to look at, that maybe we can learn something that can help us ... I always have hope.”"""
Teenage activist Greta Thunberg takes climate protest to Trump,14 Sep 2019 01:03AM,Reuters/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/teenage-activist-greta-thunberg-takes-climate-protest-to-trump-11904982," WASHINGTON: Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has shot to global fame for inspiring worldwide student strikes to promote action against climate change, took her mission to President Donald Trump’s doorstep on Friday (Sep 13) with a protest outside the White House. Hundreds of mostly young people gathered across the street from the White House to meet her carrying signs reading People or Profit?"" and ""Warming!"", chanting ""This is a crisis, act like it!"" and ""Business as usual is not enough."" Jennifer Morash, a doctoral candidate in plant science, brought her daughter Adeline, 9, to the rally after getting permission from her school in Maryland. ""I just want to make sure we all have a happy future and for people to take climate change seriously,"" Adeline said."" Many protesters laid down and kept still for 11 minutes for a ""die in"" representing 11 years they said that scientists believe the world has to make changes needed to stave off dangerous climate change. The demonstration marked the first high-profile event of Thunberg's six-day visit to Washington, intended to pressure the Trump administration ahead of a United Nations climate summit, where world leaders will be asked to ramp up their-carbon cutting ambitions to fend off global warming. Trump is among a small minority of global leaders who has openly questioned the science of climate change. He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement – a global pact to stem the rise in global temperatures - and has a policy of maximizing American production of fossil fuels. Thunberg has said she does not believe she can convince Trump or other climate change doubters that global warming is real, but hopes they will take briefings from “actual scientists and experts in this area.” The 16-year-old activist last year started skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Sweden's parliament and is bound for New York later this month, where she will take part in the U.N. climate summit. Prior to that, Thunberg will address Congress on climate change and later join Democratic lawmakers and plaintiffs in the Juliana v the United States case - in which a group of young people sued the government for failing to address climate change – at the Supreme Court. Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize earlier this year after the number of students taking part in the “Fridays for Future” school strikes broke 2 million across 135 countries. She was named one of the world’s most influential people by Time magazine in May. Conservative and far-right lawmakers in Europe have ridiculed Thunberg, mocking her as a “guru of the apocalypse” and a “Nobel prize of fear.” She was also described as a “deeply disturbed messiah” leading a “cult” in an opinion column by conservative Australian commentator Andrew Bolt. Thunberg arrived in the United States last month on a racing yacht equipped with solar panels and underwater electricity turbines to ensure that it left no carbon footprint. She is taking a year off from school to travel around the Americas."""

"Concrete steps? For China cement giants, monster carbon footprint smothers climate goals",12 Sep 2019 04:53PM (Updated: 12 Sep 2019 04:54PM),Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/concrete-steps--for-china-cement-giants--monster-carbon-footprint-smothers-climate-goals-11899760," WUHU, China: At its massive Baimashan plant near the Yangtze river in eastern China, cement giant Anhui Conch has invested the best part of US$10 million in new equipment to capture and store climate-warming greenhouse gas produced by its kilns. The pilot carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, installed last year in the city of Wuhu in Anhui province, separates and purifies 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year, which Conch will sell to industrial consumers. It's a textbook example of the kind of high-tech scheme Beijing says can help it meet lofty goals to cut pollution. But the genius of the plan is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem it seeks to address: The volume captured is a small fraction of the 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 generated annually by just one production line, and Conch is still trying to figure out how to make the technology more affordable amid scant signs of demand for the carbon. This is part of our social responsibility and if we only considered the economics we wouldn't have done it,"" said Jin Feng, who runs the Baimashan plant for Conch, a powerhouse worth about US$32 billion by market value. ""The local market (for CO2) is limited so we have no plans to expand,"" he told Reuters, speaking during a recent tour of the facility. China, in the middle of a long building boom, is by far the world's biggest consumer of cement, with total production capacity at around 55 per cent of the global total. The sector's environmental footprint is enormous, producing vast quantities of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide as well as CO2.   The global cement industry is responsible for around 7 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas, according to industry estimates, both from the production of clinker - used to make cement - from limestone and from the use of fossil fuels. Six of the world's 10 biggest cement producers are in China. CCS is just one option when it comes to cutting emissions, said Cui Xingtai, vice-president at China's biggest cement producer by volume, the China National Building Materials Co Ltd. (CNBM). ""Conch has taken the lead in carbon capture and it is loss-making for them ... but we hope the entire industry can follow,"" he told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of an industry conference. ""We are preparing to deploy this equipment. We also need to consider how to earn money from it."" ALTERNATIVE FUELS With carbon capture still out of reach for the vast majority of China's roughly 3,400 cement firms, the government has so far focused on enforcing stricter emission standards, improving energy efficiency and replacing polluting capacity with more advanced plants. The government is also trying to persuade producers to make use of alternative fuels, including municipal solid waste, tyres or methane from landfills. Producers elsewhere have successfully raised alternative fuel ratios to around 20-30 per cent - with Germany now as high as 68 per cent - but according to an estimate by Huaxin Cement, China's fifth-largest producer, the domestic ratio is about 3 per cent. Conch, which invested 60 million yuan (US$8.47 million) in the Baimashan plant's CCS equipment, has converted 11 cement projects to municipal waste, with one 14 million tonnes per year plant in Tongling now incinerating all the trash produced by the city's residents.   But overall progress has been slow: Conch has a total of more than 150 regional subsidiaries and a total production capacity of more than 200 million tonnes, around a 10th of China's total. While carbon capture could eventually play a bigger role in the sector, replacing fuel with trash could be the best short-term option to boost the cement makers' green credentials. ""The Chinese government sees the cement industry as having a role to play in disposing of municipal solid waste, and eliminating landfill,"" said Ian Riley, chief executive of the World Cement Association, speaking to Reuters during the visit to the Conch CCS facility. ""China creates 300 million tonnes a year (of municipal solid waste) and the cement industry could handle all of that."" Chinese cement industry standards for sulphur dioxide and other pollutants are now tougher than Europe, according to CNBM's Cui, raising production costs by 70 per cent in some regions. But alternative raw materials and energy sources are still needed, he said. ""It is very difficult, but the industry is working hard,"" he said."""
Climate change activists on trial in Paris for stealing Macron portraits,11 Sep 2019 05:15PM (Updated: 11 Sep 2019 07:53PM),AFP/ga/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-activists-on-trial-in-paris-for-stealing-macron-11895178," PARIS: Eight activists went on trial in Paris on Wednesday (Sep 11) for stealing official portraits of French President Emmanuel Macron from public buildings as part of a protest over climate change. The activists, aged 23 to 36, have been charged with theft after taking down the pictures from local government offices around the capital in February. The acts of civil disobedience were part of a movement called Take Down Macron"" which was intended to highlight alleged inaction by the French government over global warming. The group behind it, Non-Violent Action COP21 (ANV-COP21), claims that 128 portraits have been stolen across France, while 57 people face ""group theft"" charges which carry a maximum five-year jail term. ""We came to a point when he had tried everything,"" Felix Veve, one of the defendants, told AFP outside the court in northwest Paris on Wednesday where several hundred supporters held up banners and signs in support. ""We'd marched, we'd organised petitions, we'd tried to convince as many people as possible. The government doesn't listen. Emmanuel Macron is deaf to our calls,"" Veve said. At the end of August, several hundred protesters held up some of the stolen portraits during a protest in southwestern France near Biarritz where Macron was hosting a G7 summit of world leaders. The 41-year-old French leader said recently that he had ""changed very profoundly"" in his attitude to climate change and has promised to put the issue at the heart of the second half of his presidency. ""The mobilisation by young people for several weeks and months, that is still going on, has made me think about things,"" he told the Konbini website on Aug 23. Macron pushed fellow leaders from rich countries at the G7 to increase their commitments in cut carbon emissions, and he is also supporting global efforts to combat harmful HFC gases, which are used in air conditioning and fridges. Analysts say his new focus on environmental issues is partly due to public pressure and partly for domestic electoral reasons, with the Greens making strong gains in the European Parliament elections last May. 'SYMBOLIC ACTION' The theft of the portraits fits a pattern across Europe of increasingly radical protests by campaigners to highlight the risks of climate change, with the group Extinction Rebellion at the forefront. In July, French police were filmed spraying tear gas in the faces of protesters at point-blank range as they blocked a bridge in the centre of Paris. ""Solidarity with the people who took down the portraits of our presidential monarch,"" leftwing leader Jean-Luc Melenchon wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. The head of campaign group Oxfam in France, Cecile Duflot, also backed the protesters, writing: ""It's a symbolic action and not a group theft."" All public schools and government offices display the president's portrait, with Macron's showing him perched on the edge of his desk with two mobile phones and the memoirs of French resistance hero and post-war president Charles de Gaulle behind him. It is not the first time Macron's picture has been targeted. In October 2017, mayors in the central Creuse region turned his picture around so that Macron faced the wall, to protest cuts to local government budgets and job losses. The first trial over the thefts of presidential portraits took place at the end of May in the eastern town of Bourg-en-Bresse. An environmental campaigner was fined €250 (US$275) and five others received suspended fines."""
Air conditioning for all? Hotter world faces risk of 'cooling poverty',11 Sep 2019 12:02PM (Updated: 11 Sep 2019 12:13PM),Reuters/jt,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-air-conditioning-hotter-world-risk-11893770," OXFORD: As climate change brings more frequent and extreme heatwaves around the world, demand for air conditioners is soaring, with 10 new units sold every second on average - but the poor may be left to swelter, said a University of Oxford researcher. By 2050, energy use for cooling is projected to triple, while in hot countries like India, China, Brazil and Indonesia, it is expected to grow five-fold, the World Bank has said. By the end of the century, global energy demand for cooling will be more than it is for heating,” said Radhika Khosla, who leads an Oxford Martin School programme on future cooling. But not everyone will be able to afford to beat the heat. “Traditionally, energy poverty has been defined as people not having heating. Now that is potentially going to shift, and we could have cooling poverty,” Khosla warned on the sidelines of a conference on efforts to slash planet-warming emissions. Rising heat is having a huge impact on health – deaths and hospital admissions jump in heatwaves – but also on productivity as workers struggle to cope, climate scientists say. A 2018 report from Sustainable Energy for All, a UN-backed organisation, said more than 1.1 billion people globally faced immediate risks from lack of access to cooling. On a warming planet, cooling is not a luxury but ""essential for everyday life"", said the organisation's CEO Rachel Kyte. But because air conditioners use 20 times as much power as running a fan, their growing popularity could fuel demand for fossil fuel-based electricity that exacerbates climate change. Rather than relying entirely on air conditioning, buildings should be designed so they are easier to keep cool, which is still rare, said Khosla, who also directs research at the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development. Her modern apartment has windows that open just a few inches, making it hard to keep cool on hot days, she said.   “Net zero” buildings – designed partly to stay cool without heavy use of air conditioning – are popping up around the world, from Southeast Asia to the United States and Europe, but remain the exception, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Khosla, who has herself lived in a range of hot cities from New Delhi to Chicago, predicted that in the future, housing that cannot be kept cool or have air conditioning installed could see a drop in value, even in relatively cool places such as Britain. NEW TECHNOLOGY In some developing nations with rising incomes, buying an air conditioner is also a status symbol, which could make any push for lower-energy alternatives challenging, she said. Making less power-hungry, affordable air conditioners will be crucial, Khosla believes. Most machines for sale now – the majority built in China – are half as energy-efficient as they could be, she said. But researchers are working on more efficient cooling technologies that could hit the market in as little as two years, Khosla said. Judges are now looking at entries for a US$3 million global cooling prize, launched by the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute, aimed at developing an affordable window air conditioning unit that is at least five times more efficient than current models. Amory Lovins, co-founder of the institute, said designing cheaper, greener air conditioning was ""extremely important"". Getting manufacturers to ramp up production fast - partly by putting in place policies that require greater energy efficiency - will also be key, Khosla said. Greener cooling is ""one of the levers we have left"" to hold the line on climate change, and using less energy for cooling would help avert power blackouts in cities on sizzling days, she said. Cities face an ""awful feedback loop"" as air conditioners churn out hot exhaust, boosting temperatures further, she said. All these risks mean smarter cooling must be figured out quickly, before the world gets even hotter and more families rush to appliance shops, she said. “It’s a future we can’t afford to get wrong,” she warned."""
"World must adapt to 'inevitable' climate change, warns report",10 Sep 2019 12:09PM (Updated: 10 Sep 2019 04:09PM),AFP/nc/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/new-climate-change-report-world-must-adapt-warning-11890192," PARIS: Nations rich and poor must invest now to protect against the effects of climate change or pay an even heavier price later, a global commission warned on Tuesday (Sep 10). Spending US$1.8 trillion across five key areas over the next decade would not only help buffer the worst impacts of global warming but could generate more than US$7 trillion in net benefits, the report from the Global Commission on Adaptation argued. We are the last generation that can change the course of climate change, and we are the first generation that then has to live with the consequences,"" former UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who chairs the commission, said at the report's launch in Beijing. ""Delay and pay, or plan and prosper,"" he said, sharing a catchphrase from the commission, which is co-chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva. Investing now in early warning systems, climate-resistant infrastructure, mangrove protection, better agriculture and improving fresh water resources would pay for itself several times over, the report said. Mangroves - tropical tidal water forests - protect, for example, against storm surges and act as nurseries for commercial fisheries, but at least a third of them globally have been uprooted for tourism or aquaculture. ""Global actions to slow climate change are promising but insufficient,"" the report stated. ""We must invest in a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable."" Without action by 2030, climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line, said the report. At the launch, Chinese environment minister Li Ganjie - whose country is the world's top carbon polluter - called adaptation practices ""an inherent requirement of China's sustainable development"". In the 25-year history of UN climate negotiations, adaptation has trailed far down the agenda compared with ""mitigation"", or the reduction of carbon emissions. It was long seen as an issue only affecting poor and developing nations. But recent massive inland flooding and a string of record-breaking hurricanes in the United States, along with ferocious heatwaves in Europe and Japan, have shown that wealth is not an adequate shield. Dominic Molloy, a co-author of the report from Britain's Department for International Development, said a new focus on adapting should not detract from the need to slash carbon pollution. ""We absolutely need to do both, reduce emissions and adapt,"" Molloy told AFP. ""The purpose of this commission was to raise the visibility of adaptation, not shift away from mitigation."" COST OF FAILURE Failure to curb the greenhouse gas emissions slow-roasting the planet has already unleashed a crescendo of deadly heat waves, water shortages and superstorms made more destructive by rising seas. The Bahamas was devastated this month by one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.   Earth's average surface temperature has gone up 1 degree C since the late 19th century, and is on track - at current rates of CO2 emissions - to warm another two or three degrees by the century's end. The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for capping global warming at ""well below"" 2 degrees C, and 1.5 degrees C if possible, but it was given a hit when US President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2017. ""I sincerely hope that President Trump will return to Paris climate agreement and do something good for humanity,"" Ban said. The report's US$1.8 trillion adaptation price tag for the period 2020-2030 is not an estimate of global needs, covering only warning systems and the four other areas identified. The US$7.1 trillion dividend is based on the World Bank calculation that the value of damage caused by climate change is increasing, averaged across the globe, at about 1.5 per cent per year. Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the centre that commissioned the report, described the proposal as a ""global Marshall Plan"" - the US aid programme that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II."""
Commentary: The finance sector is already moving away from fossil-fuel investments,09 Sep 2019 06:23AM (Updated: 20 Sep 2019 07:57AM),Project Syndicate/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/finance-investments-climate-action-global-warming-fossil-fuels-11869996," OXFORD: Some of the most influential players in the global economy are spearheading the shift toward a clean, green, emissions-free world, even while key governments stand idle. Financial giants from Europe, China, Japan, the United States, Australia, and elsewhere can see the looming risks and rewards, and they are not waiting on policymakers to signal what needs to be done. By setting immediate bans on new fossil-fuel investments, labelling clean and dirty energy producers, and dumping unappealing stocks, the financial industry is redirecting huge flows of money from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. INVESTMENTS IS MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLES Such decisions can ripple across economies. Consider, for example, the split between state and private energy finance in India. According to the Delhi-based Centre for Financial Accountability, primary finance for coal-fired power plants dropped by 93 per cent between 2017 and 2018, while finance for renewables rose by 10 per cent. Among the loans for coal projects in 2018, most came from government-controlled financial institutions, whereas three-quarters of renewables financing came from private commercial banks. Similarly, banks and traders in Japan are abandoning coal projects in favour of renewables, even though the government has resisted setting a phase-out date for coal-powered energy.   Three Japanese coal-plant projects have been cancelled or delayed this year. And at the global level, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that investments in coal-power plants hit a century low in 2018, while more coal generators were retired. SHIFTING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS This trend will become more pronounced as the number of financial firms shifting from fossil fuels continues to grow. Consider the headlines since March. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has won parliamentary approval to divest US$13 billion from fossil-fuel stocks, as part of the largest fossil-fuel selloff to date. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, one of the world’s largest banks in terms of assets, ceased financing new coal-fired power projects. And Chubb became the first major US insurer to announce a ban on coal coverage, while Suncorp became the last Australian insurer to end coverage for new coal-mining and coal-power projects. Moreover, the London Stock Exchange has recategorised oil and gas stocks as “non-renewable energy” and classified green-energy stocks as “renewable” instead of “alternative.” The Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation said it would end financing for coal-power plants (once it finishes two final projects in Vietnam), Meanwhile China's State Development & Investment Corporation has announced plans to stop investing in new coal-fired plants and focus on new energy sources.   More broadly, the Investor Agenda for a low-carbon world has attracted 477 signatories, representing around US$34 trillion in assets under management. These investors are calling on governments not just to limit rising temperatures, but also to meet the Paris climate agreement’s more difficult goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A FINANCIAL HIT FOR THE REST Meanwhile, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis has found that those who ignored climate-change warnings have already taken a financial hit. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, lost around US$90 billion over the last decade, three-quarters of which was due to its holdings in ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP. And investors in General Electric, including BlackRock, lost a whopping US$193 billion in the three years leading up to 2018, because the company misjudged the pace of the shift to green energy and the collapse in demand for gas turbines and thermal power stations. THE LOOMING TSUNAMI Although the shift away from fossil fuels is already monumental, a potential tsunami awaits. Those divesting from fossil fuels are the early adopters who have sensed a change in wind direction and readjusted their sails. But far more needs to be done.   Because those firms’ competitors have yet to take any steps toward divestment, trillions of dollars in carbon assets remain on investors’ balance sheets. Moreover, according to the IEA, while coal investments have fallen, capital spending on oil, gas, and coal nonetheless bounced back in 2018, and investment in energy efficiency and renewables stalled. Worse, the consultancy Wood Mackenzie finds that the renewables boom has translated into only 2 per cent of global energy demand. As matters stand, coal, oil, and gas could still supply 85 per cent of primary energy by 2040, down only slightly from 90 per cent today. MORE TO BE DONE To complete the transition away from fossil fuels will require drilling down to the core of the global economy. It does not help that financial institutions in China funneled at least US$1 billion in “green” financing to coal-related projects in the first half of this year. Companies cannot keep producing oil, gas, and internal combustion engines while gradually shifting to cleaner technologies; they need to make a clean break.   Moreover, financiers need to look beyond coal and withdraw support for all fossil fuels. Equally important, governments must set an ambitious trajectory for their economies that impels adherence to the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on warming. Our current path will lead to warming of 3 degrees Celsius or more, which would have catastrophic consequences. AN OPPORTUNITY IN SEPTEMBER The United Nations Climate Action Summit on Sep 23 offers the opportunity for financial institutions and governments to do what is necessary. Secretary-General has called for gold-standard leadership, in the form of government and private-sector commitments to slash emissions to net zero, with interim targets every five years. Guterres’s call to action is echoed by all who have been demonstrating and striking for the same goal. Investors need to rise to the occasion, by structuring portfolios in such a way as to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.   That means pushing the companies in their portfolios to change, too, or risk being cut off and left behind. But setting long-term aspirations won’t be enough. Actionable steps for the coming months and years must accompany the commitments made today, to ensure that progress remains on track, and climate commitments by countries, businesses, cities, and others are recorded. The bigger the divestment movement grows, the harder it will be to hide in the shadows, clinging to the past. Andrew Higham is Chief Executive of Mission 2020 and a visiting fellow of practice at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government."
The Big Read: Taking the climate fight beyond straws and tote bags — individual actions that matter,09 Sep 2019 06:20AM (Updated: 09 Sep 2019 06:30AM),TODAY/mn(sl),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/climate-change-environment-fight-beyond-straws-tote-bags-11884462," SINGAPORE: In a country where most people do not think twice about buying new clothes, Mr Leow Yee Shiang has not bought a single piece of clothing in the past two years. The 31-year-old civil servant practises what he calls a “minimalist lifestyle”. He rarely shops, and has only bought four items for himself this year – a water bottle, socks, lenses for his sunglasses and a motorcycle plate number. What sparked the decision? Mr Leow said it happened early last year when he was packing his belongings for his return to Singapore from Australia, where he had been living with his wife for two years because of work. I got a bit fed-up as I was packing … There were many boxes. I got so angry at myself that I just started throwing away things. Among some of the items which he threw out included his wedding photo and its frame, as well as the love letters he got from his wife when they were dating. It means that he can now “focus on cherishing” their relationship, he said with a smile. Another person who has gone to the extremes to reduce his carbon footprint is Mr Tan Hang Chong. Mr Tan is the co-founder of Foodscape Collective, a community group that aims to raise awareness about food waste. He does not switch on the lights in his house, even at night. Instead, he relies on light which filters in from the corridors or neighbouring flats, and even showers in the dark. Mr Tan said that the idea to live this way occurred to him after he started pondering about ways to reduce his electricity bill several years ago. “I realised that while I was always so conscious about light pollution and its impact on wildlife … why not harness the light pollution?” he said.   Mr Leow and Mr Tan may be outliers but anecdotally, more and more Singaporeans are taking the effort to do their bit for the environment — in particular, by using reuseable straws and bringing their own tote bags for grocery shopping. Many of those who swear by reuseable straws would recall watching a video of a turtle with a straw stuck in its nose, which went viral on social media some years ago. The anti-plastic straw movement got a boost last year, with big corporations such as coffee giant Starbucks announcing that they would eliminate plastic straws and other disposables from their premises. The surge in sales of reusable straws comes on the heels of other trendy environmental efforts such as the use of tote bags, which at one point were seen as the panacea to plastic bags and freely given out at some retail establishments. In Singapore, several supermarkets have also introduced reusable bags for sale, or have given them away for free to discourage consumers from using plastic bags. Such initiatives come as the effects of climate change are being felt around the world with increasing intensity — from erratic weather patterns to melting of glaciers, and rising sea levels. Singapore has not been spared either, with long spells of hot weather and heavier rainfall becoming the new normal in recent years. Indeed, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently urged the nation to see climate-change mitigation measures like how it treats the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) — “with utmost seriousness”. “Both the SAF and climate change defences are existential for us. These are life and death matters,” he said during his National Day Rally speech on Aug 18, noting that low-lying Singapore is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. While there has been a greater awareness among Singaporeans on the gravity of the climate change problem in recent years, not everyone is aware of what they can do to make a meaningful difference — beyond the use of reuseable straws and bags, which some environmentalists have noted do not make a huge impact in the grand scheme of things. Mr Ho Xiang Tian, 23, the co-founder of sustainability interest group LepakInSG, recounted an incident where he had refused a straw at a food establishment, only to see the cashier accidentally knock over an entire packet of straws onto the floor, rendering them unusable.   “It was in that instant when I realised that I could refuse a straw 100 times, but in three seconds the cashier negated all my efforts,” he said. Still, environmental experts and activists reiterated the importance of individual action. After all, great social movements start from the convictions of a few before reaching a tipping point, they noted. The world will be “on a path to failure” if people do not believe in individual actions, said Mr Michael Broadhead, a board member at environmental non-profit Centre for a Responsible Future and founder of EarthFest Singapore. “Any social change at the beginning has a few people making change. They do it because they see a better way and are passionate about it,” he said. “Eventually these people spread awareness and educate more people to adopt those habits, reaching a tipping point to become mainstream.” Despite its detractors, the anti-plastic straw movement around the world is a case in point: Individual actions can generate enough momentum to lead to changes in business and government policies. Starbucks, for instance, announced last year that it would eliminate plastic straws by 2020. At home, fast-food chain McDonalds announced earlier this week that it would remove straws from selected outlets. These developments — or “small victories” as some would say — suggest that if individuals make other lifestyle changes, they can collectively make a tangible impact in saving the environment. Here is an in-depth look at five things which individuals can do to make a real difference: 1. SWITCH OFF THE AIR-CON   The air-conditioner is ubiquitous in Singapore given its tropical climate — it is found in 99 per cent of condominium units, and almost every public building here, for example. While Singapore’s first prime minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had once described air-conditioning as the greatest invention in history and viewed air-conditioners in civil-service buildings as key to public efficiency, air-conditioners can consume up to half of a building’s energy needs, contributing to climate change. The amount of energy required to cool Singapore is expected to grow by 73 per cent between 2010 and 2030, said Associate Professor Lee Poh Seng from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Not only are air-conditioners prevalent in most buildings, they are turned on excessively: A survey conducted late-2017 by environmental news website Eco-Business found that 68 per cent of Singapore residents felt that it was too cold in buildings – the highest proportion among six ASEAN countries surveyed. Without any change in consumption habits, energy consumption in all ASEAN countries is likely to increase by a compound annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent by 2030. According to the SP Group’s website, the air-conditioner is the biggest energy guzzler at home, with its power input reaching as high as 3,000 watts. Based on calculations from “What is My Carbon Footprint” website, an individual living in a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat who often uses air-conditioner and other large electrical appliances — such as refrigerators, water heaters and televisions — can generate 1 tonne of carbon emissions a year. By reducing usage, the individual can cut his or her carbon footprint by half. However, based on random interviews with some Singaporeans, it seems that giving up air-conditioning or just setting the machine a few degrees Celsius higher is a big ask for people here. Ms Priya Chandran, a first-year student at Nanyang Technological University, said that she would usually leave her air-conditioner at home running for up to 10 hours a day overnight. While the 21-year-old is aware of its environmental impact, she considers the air-conditioner as necessary in Singapore’s hot and humid climate. “It's very hot. When I'm outside, I don't have the same access to air-conditioning that I have at home, so I would like to make optimal use of that comfort while I'm resting,” she said. When asked if she was prepared to switch to environment-friendly options at home, Ms Chandran said that she would only do so if they offered the same chillness as her current air-conditioner, and if the alternatives were within her budget. Mr Rishvinder Singh, who lives in a four-room HDB flat, said his family leaves two of their air-conditioners switched on for up to five hours each night. When told that he could potentially cut his carbon footprint by half if he were to stop using air-conditioners, Mr Singh, 25, said that while he would consider reducing usage, he would need regular reminders to do so. “Although there are a lot of push factors against using the air-conditioner frequently because of climate change, it’s a very difficult change to implement throughout the entire country because Singapore is hot and humid, even at night,” said the teacher. 2. DRIVE LESS   Leaving the car at home and making greater use of public transport is another step that Singaporeans can take to reduce their carbon footprints. The number of cars on the roads in Singapore remains high, even as the Government continues to promote public transport as part of its 2040 land transport master plan. As of July, figures from the Land Transport Authority showed that there were about 967,800 vehicles on the road. Of these, 556,200 were private cars while another 91,700 were taxis and private-hire cars. According to the National Climate Change Secretariat, private cars make up the largest share of emissions by the transport sector at 35 per cent. This is followed by commercial vehicles (26 per cent), taxis (17 per cent), bus (15 per cent), MRT and LRT (4 per cent) and motorcycles (3 per cent). While there are no official figures available on the amount of carbon emissions generated by private car use, the transport sector made up close to 14 per cent of total emissions in 2014, and the figure is projected to increase by 0.5 per cent next year under a business-as-usual scenario. A study by Assistant Professor Lynette Cheah from the Singapore University of Technology and Design estimated that cars alone generated 2.2 kg of carbon per litre of petrol. Figures from the Transport Ministry also show that travelling by car generates about 14 times more emissions (187 gCO2/passenger-km) compared with travelling by MRT (13 gCO2/passenger-km). In a separate study, the average occupancy of cars in Singapore was found to be about 1.7 people per car — and this reflected “immense inefficiencies”, said Asst Prof Cheah. Like many working professionals, lawyer Melissa Tham, 29, typically travels by car. Each day, she either takes a private-hire car or gets a lift from her family to travel from her home in Upper Thomson to her workplace at Marina Bay Financial Centre. This comes up to 0.02 tonnes of carbon emissions per week, or about 1 tonne per year. The figure excludes her travels by private-hire car or taxis during the weekend, which can come up to about six trips each weekend.   While Ms Tham is aware that travelling via public transport will significantly reduce her carbon footprint, she cited convenience as the key reason for continuing to take private-hire cars or taxis. “I live with my parents and we don’t live near an MRT station, with the nearest being 20 minutes away, and it’s really too long and time consuming for me to walk there,” she said. She added that with a new MRT station coming up near her home, she might switch to public transport in future. For Mr Ash Lim, 45, cost had been the major factor — rather than a desire to save the environment — in giving up his car about three years ago. The managing director of a theatre company said that he had decided not to get another car after he scrapped his car in 2016 due to high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices. He added that using the train to get from his Aljunied home to his workplace in the Central Business District “was not really difficult”. He only takes a taxi or private-hire car about twice a week, he said. Nevertheless, he said he may think about getting a car again if he moves to another place further from his office, for example. On whether the level of carbon emissions generated from driving would be a consideration, he said it would be “a small, but not deciding factor”. Building more connected infrastructure is one of the ways in which the Government hopes to cut down on emissions intensity generated by road transport. In 2017, 67 per cent of trips during peak hours were made by public transport. The Government is aiming to increase this to 75 per cent by 2030, and 85 per cent by 2050. However, Asst Prof Cheah noted that several hurdles remain in the drive for a car-lite nation, such as the growing population and a tendency for car owners to drive as much as they can to maximise their financial outlay on the vehicles. A tax based on mileage rather than ownership, which is currently the case, could deter people from taking the car, she added. 3. EAT LESS MEAT   Reducing meat consumption is one of the most significant ways for an individual to reduce his or her carbon footprint. The animal agriculture sector has been identified as a key source of greenhouse gas, with deforestation to grow crops for animal feed contributing to global warming. Beef in particular, is more potent in terms of carbon emissions than other forms of meat. More resources are required to produce beef. Cows also release methane which is 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. A 2014 study of meals in the United Kingdom found that vegetarians generated about half the amount of carbon dioxide (3.8kg) compared to those who had more than 100g of meat a day (7.2 kg). A study by medical journal The Lancet in January recommended that people eat a plant-based diet, with the occasional inclusion of meat, dairy and sugar in their meals. However, figures from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority showed that on average, each Singaporean ate 2kg of beef, 3kg of mutton and 20kg of pork in 2017. This works out to about 68g of meat consumed per day — nearly five times the 14g of meat a day recommended by The Lancet study. Some environmentally-conscious individuals admitted that they had struggled to make a complete switch to vegetarianism or veganism due to nutritional issues or opposition by family members. Vegetarians are those who do not eat meat products while vegans do not eat meat and other products derived from animals such as milk or honey. However, there are Singaporeans who have successfully made the change such as Mr Hilmi Hayan, an entrepreneur and bodybuilder. The 25-year-old decided to go vegan several years ago after watching a small bird killed for food. Mr Hilmi, who rarely ate vegetables before turning vegan, said that he subsequently learnt about the destruction and level of carbon emission involved in producing meat, and this reaffirmed his decision to stay vegan. 4. BUY LESS, THROW AWAY LESS Last year, Singaporeans threw out about 7.7 million tonnes of waste, enough to fill about 15,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. On a daily basis, this is equivalent to the weight of more than 1,400 double-decker buses. Mr Leow, the civil servant who practises a minimalist lifestyle, felt that Singaporeans’ tendency to buy things and throw them away soon after was symptomatic of the country’s affluence.   He has only 20 pieces of clothing in total and he avoids spending money on new items unless they are absolutely necessary. He extends the life of his personal possessions by repairing or repurposing them. Mr Leow is an anomaly in Singapore, where most people are victims of “fast fashion”. In 2016, a CNA survey of 1,000 respondents found that on average, Singaporeans bought about 34 pieces of new clothing each year, driven by the lure of cheap prices. They also threw out an average of 27 items of clothing per year. Only 6 per cent of 220,000 tonnes of textiles and leather generated in Singapore was recycled last year. According to the United Nations, if the fashion industry does not adopt more sustainable methods of production, it will represent 26 per cent of global carbon emissions, up from 10 per cent now. Corporate communications senior executive Manesh Rangarajan, for example, buys at least one new item each month, including clothes. Despite being aware of the environmental costs of the mostly imported fast-fashion, Mr Manesh felt that there is little incentive to buy local products to reduce the environmental cost of clothes. Mr Manesh, who refreshes his wardrobe every two to three years, said: “It’s hard to think about carbon footprint when you live in Singapore where everything is imported.” “The made-in-Singapore items are mostly pricey and the affordability of ready-to-wear items by bigger brands is a bigger draw,” said the 30-year-old who window shops online on a daily basis. 5. TAKE FEWER FLIGHTS   The aviation industry generates 2 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and 12 per cent of carbon emissions among all forms of transport. While they seem small, figures by the European Environment Agency show that flying emits 285g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, exceeding 158g by road and 14g by rail for each passenger. A study in 2012 on the carbon footprint of the aviation industry also found that within Asia, Singapore generated 9.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions in terms of departing flights, second only to Hong Kong (10.4 million tonnes). The study also found that the route between London and Singapore generated the highest amount of carbon emissions. With Singapore being a travel hub and its citizens avid travellers, this amount of carbon emissions is unlikely to abate. Last year, Changi Airport Group posted its highest passenger haul of 65.6 million, a 5.5 per cent increase from the year before. While the global aviation industry has committed to improving its fuel efficiency per year from 2009 to 2020 and reduce its net aviation carbon emissions in half by 2050 (relative to 2005 levels), it remains to be seen whether travellers’ mindsets will change. Consultant Yoong Leong Yan flies to Kuala Lumpur monthly for work. On the idea of taking a coach instead of a flight, the 51-year-old said: “The coach is not convenient because of the time and because you need to get on and off at the checkpoint immigration.” He added: “My main consideration is the efficiency (of the travel mode) and to get … the business done.” Still, some are making the adjustments, including Mr Tan, the co-founder of Foodscape Collective. He tries to limit his travel, only travelling in the region when he needs to. He also lengthens his stay when he travels — getting more done, instead of having to fly to and fro — and offsets his carbon emissions through green activities. INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS COUNT, BUT GOVTS & FIRMS THE REAL GAME-CHANGERS While making changes to their lifestyle could significantly cut down Singaporeans’ average carbon emissions, several interviewed cited cost, inconvenience or peer-pressure as reasons for not doing so. Some also pointed to Singapore’s negligible contribution to global carbon emissions, and felt that any drastic changes to their lifestyles — along with the inconveniences — are not worth it. The website What is My Carbon Footprint showed that the average Singaporean generates 9 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, more than twice the world’s average, and more than four times the target to maintain a sustainable footprint. At the same time, Singapore contributes to only 0.1 per cent of global carbon emissions. Reflecting a common mindset among most individuals, Mr Manesh said: I think saving the environment is important. And I have made some changes to do so. But with the emissions in Singapore being so low, I would not go out of my way to make drastic changes to the way I do things. But I have and will make a conscious effort if it is convenient for me. Green advocates, however, want Singaporeans to know that individual actions count much more than they think. Ms Melissa Tan, 27, founder of Bamboo Straw Girl, a business selling biodegradable straws, stressed that changing everyday habits would encourage people to think about the consequences of their actions. “When collective change becomes a habit, our values as a community change. This will be reflected in the policies we push for,” she said. Ultimately, governments and businesses are the real game-changers — but it is individuals who collectively send a message and drive the behaviours of governments and businesses. Said Mr Ho of Lepak in SG: People need to think about what kind of future they want to live in, and actively take steps to talk to those in power about what they want to see and how they think those in power could help bring about this vision of what they want to see in the future. Worldwide, there is a growing sense that corporations and governments are not pulling their weight on climate action policies, amid various reports and studies sounding the alarm on the pace of global warming. The perceived lack of urgency has led to climate strikes being held regularly around the world, such as the Fridays for Future school strikes launched by Swedish student activist Greta Thunberg.   The activism has also reached Singapore’s shores, with a group of youths organising the Singapore Climate Rally at Hong Lim Park on Sep 21 to push the Government to adopt more stringent climate action policies. Ms Annika Mock, 20, who is part of the rally’s organising committee, said that youths are living in “a very important moment in history”, with governments’ actions today likely to “echo into the decades” to come. At a country level, Mr Marc Allen, technical director at energy and climate change consultancy Engeco, said that consumers have the power to lobby for change by demanding low-carbon options and transparency in emission data. Mr Allen cited the examples of banks and institutional investors relooking the impact of their portfolios on the environment, as a result of public pressure. The impact of public pressure has not gone unnoticed in Singapore, with a spate of recent moves by companies to adopt more environmentally-friendly alternatives. NTUC FairPrice, for instance, announced on Wednesday (Sept 4) that shoppers will be charged for plastic bags at selected outlets.   While more stringent, sustainable policies entail trade-offs — such as in the form of higher costs of eco-friendly production methods — economic growth and combating climate change do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive, experts stressed. Moving towards a smaller carbon footprint could also create economic opportunities for governments, especially in the areas of innovative business models and new technology, said Mr Allen. SINGAPORE MAY BE SMALL BUT IT ‘CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE’ The Singapore Government has been proactive in fighting climate change: Apart from initiatives such as the introduction of carbon tax at the start of this year, it launched the Zero Waste Masterplan last month which aims to reduce the waste sent to the landfill each day by 30 per cent by 2030. Still, some Singapore government and business leaders have alluded to the fact that even if Singapore were to cut its carbon emissions, it would have little impact on a global scale. But this does not mean that Singapore’s role does not matter on the international stage, said Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency Member of Parliament Louis Ng. Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at NUS’ Energy Studies Institute, stressed that Singapore’s size “should not be an excuse for inaction”. She noted that while Singapore accounted for a minute percentage of global emissions, some activists had pointed out that industries based here could generate a much larger carbon footprint through their emissions in other countries and measures are needed to mitigate against that. Mr Ng said that Singapore’s hosting of next month’s meetings by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that the world looked to Singapore “as a leader”. “If we do something, the rest will follow. Even (former United States president) Barack Obama has said that Singapore punches above its weight. We do it for economic and other issues, why don’t we do it for climate change as well?” he added.

Big Oil undermines UN climate goals with US$50b of new projects: Report,06 Sep 2019 07:36AM,Reuters/nc,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/oil-majors-paris-agreement-climate-change-projects-11878824," LONDON: Major oil companies have approved US$50 billion of projects since last year that will not be economically viable if governments implement the Paris Agreement on climate change, think-tank Carbon Tracker said in a report published on Friday (Sep 6). The analysis found that investment plans by Royal Dutch Shell, BP and ExxonMobil among other companies will not be compatible with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5 degree Celsius world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals,"" said report co-author Andrew Grant, a former natural resources analyst at Barclays. Big oil and gas companies have welcomed the UN-backed Paris Agreement, in which governments agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Scientists view 1.5 degrees Celsius as a tipping point where climate impacts such as sea-level rise, natural disasters, forced migration, failed harvests and deadly heatwaves will rapidly start to intensify if it is breached. Carbon Tracker's analysis, co-authored by Mike Coffin, a former geologist at BP, found that 18 newly approved oil and gas projects worth US$50 billion could be left ""deep out of the money"" in a lower carbon world. The projects include Shell's US$13 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) Canada LNG project, a US$4.3 billion oilfield expansion project in Azerbaijan owned by BP, Exxon, Chevron and Equinor, and a US$1.3 billion deepwater project in Angola operated by BP, Exxon, Chevron, Total and Equinor. The report also concluded that oil and gas companies risk ""wasting"" US$2.2 trillion by 2030 on new projects if governments apply stricter curbs on greenhouse gas emissions. Previous reports on the implications of climate change for oil and gas companies by Carbon Tracker and other researchers have contributed to a wave of investor pressure on majors to show that their investments are aligned with the Paris goals. While some companies including Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have increased spending on renewable energy and introduced carbon reduction targets, the sector says it needs to continue investing in new projects to meet future demand for oil and gas as Asian economies expand. Shell said in a statement that it has set out an ""ambition"" to halve net carbon emissions by 2050 ""in step with society as it moves towards meeting the aims of Paris."" ""As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need,"" Shell said. BP said its strategy to produce low cost and low carbon oil and gas was in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts and the Paris agreement. ""All of this is aimed at evolving BP from an oil and gas focused company to a much broader energy company so that we are best equipped to help the world get to net zero while meeting rising energy demand,"" the company said in a statement. Exxon, Chevron, Equinor and Total did not reply to requests for comment. Nevertheless, the latest Carbon Tracker report said the big oil and gas companies spent at least 30 per cent of their investment last year on projects that are inconsistent with the path to limit global warming to even 1.6 degrees Celsius. ""These projects represent an imminent challenge for investors and companies looking to align with climate goals,"" the report warned. Carbon Tracker's calculations were based on three scenarios produced by the Paris-based IEA models of oil and gas supply under different warming pathways. With fossil fuel supply on course to outstrip demand if the world is to limit warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report assumed that the projects with the lowest production costs would be the most competitive. ""Demand for oil can be satisfied with projects that break even at below US$40 per barrel and pursuing higher-cost projects risks creating stranded assets that will never deliver adequate returns,"" the report said. Benchmark crude futures were trading at around US$62 per barrel on Thursday."""
"China CO2 emissions to peak in 2022, ahead of schedule: Government researcher",05 Sep 2019 09:02PM,Reuters/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-co2-emissions-to-peak-in-2022-ahead-of-schedule-government-11876906," FUXIAN LAKE, China: China's emissions of climate-warming greenhouse gases are likely to peak by 2022 even without the introduction of tougher policies, well ahead of an original target of around"" 2030, a senior government researcher said on Thursday (Sep 5). China's pledge to bring emissions to a peak by ""around 2030"" was a key component of a global pact to tackle climate change drawn up in Paris in 2015. Beijing has since promised to show ""the highest possible ambition"" when reviewing its targets, and a government think tank has urged Beijing to introduce stricter measures for its next 2021-2025 ""five-year plan"". But Jiang Kejun, research professor with the Energy Research Institute, a unit of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top planning body, said he had ""extreme confidence"" in Beijing's ability to bring emissions to a peak by 2022 on just a ""business as usual"" trajectory. ""China already has very strong policies and for me, just continuing to do that could be enough,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Fortune Sustainability Forum at the Fuxian Lake in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Any change in the official targets of the world's biggest CO2 emitter is likely to have big implications for the global fight against climate change, but Chinese government officials have remained cautious about revising their forecasts. Li Gao, head of the climate department at the environment ministry, warned last week that the 2030 target was already at risk from the trade war with the United States. After slowing from 2014 to 2016, China's total carbon emissions are believed to have rebounded starting from 2017. According to estimates published on Thursday by Lauri Myllyvirta, senior energy analyst with environmental group Greenpeace, emissions rose by as much as 4 per cent in the first half of this year, driven by rising coal, steel and cement consumption. One major concern has been the rebound in coal consumption and the possible approval of new coal-fired power projects, with officials now debating whether more capacity is required to meet future electricity shortages, said Yang Fuqiang, senior adviser with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based environmental group. An industry group has forecast China's coal-fired capacity to peak at 1,300 gigawatts (GW), an increase of nearly 300 GW compared to the end of last year. Eric Luo, chief executive of Chinese renewable energy manufacturer GCL, said it was unlikely another 300 GW would be necessary, adding that a 2022 peak in carbon emissions was plausible. ""After 2022, coal emissions should slow down, with the number of new coal plants falling,"" he told Reuters. ""Even if they have approved another 200GW ... it doesn't make sense to build so much."""""
"Asia's growing coal use could negate global climate change progress, UN says",04 Sep 2019 05:47PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/asia-s-growing-coal-use-could-negate-global-climate-change-progress--un-says-11872326," BANGKOK: Asia's heavy and expanding reliance on coal power risks cancelling out global progress towards preventing catastrophic climate change, a top United Nations official warned on Wednesday (Sep 4). While developing economies such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam increasingly turn to cheap coal to meet fast-growing demand for electricity, some nations are ramping up use of renewable energy, although its share of the total fuel mix for power generation is still small. Asian countries must set more ambitious goals to contribute to global efforts to curb climate change, said Ovais Sarmad, the deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. There are certain countries in this region still relying heavily on coal and fossil fuels as sources of energy, and in some areas that is growing,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""That's a very, very serious problem because ... all those gains that had been made in other parts of the world would be completely negated."" The comment came as officials of Asian nations met in the Thai capital of Bangkok this week to discuss ways to spur regional, and global, efforts to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement aims to limit the global average temperature increase to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Current policies put the world on track for a rise of at least 3 degrees Celsius by century's end. Further warming could push the climate system closer to irreversible tipping points, scientists warn, raising the risk of harvest failures, forced migration, mass extinction of species, ecosystem collapse and societal breakdown. Some major Asian cities, such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, are also at risk of submersion, as sea levels rise. ""Radical, transformative and highly ambitious actions need to happen at all levels,"" Sarmad said. ""We have very little time."" The Bangkok conference comes ahead of a climate summit in New York this month, and December's UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Chile."""
Pope heads to Mozambique to help consolidate peace,04 Sep 2019 03:19PM,Reuters/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-heads-to-mozambique-to-help-consolidate-peace-11871680," VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis heads to Mozambique on Wednesday (Sep 4) to encourage the country's fragile peace, starting a three-nation African tour where climate change, poverty and corruption will also be high on the agenda. The former Portuguese colony emerged from 15 years of civil war in 1992 but it was only last month that President Filipe Nyusi of the ruling Frelimo party and the leader of the Renamo opposition, Ossufo Momade, signed a permanent ceasefire. With elections scheduled for October, some fear violence may break out. He is coming at a time when we Mozambicans are trying to consolidate peace,"" said Manuela Muianga, a biologist and disaster relief manager in the capital, Maputo. ""We Catholics feel that he is a visionary man who can help Mozambique to strengthen hope and make us forget all those things that make us fight against each other. The biggest concern is the fighting between the two parties. I'm sure he will address this,"" she said. Francis, who is expected to talk about peace when he meets Mozambique's leaders on Thursday, mentioned his concern in a video message to the country ahead of the seven-day trip, which will also take him to Madagascar and Mauritius. ""I think he is going to give a forceful message to the country's leaders about their responsibility to bring about peace and reconciliation, but also about addressing the root causes of the conflict,"" said Erica Dahl-Bredine, Mozambique country representative for Catholic Relief Services. Climate change is expected to be a topic in Mozambique and Madagascar. Deforestation, along with soil erosion, made Mozambique more vulnerable when two cyclones hit the country this year. Francis, making his second trip to sub-Saharan Africa, will not be able to visit the city of Beira because of the devastation. According to the World Bank, Mozambique has lost 8 million hectares of forest, about the size of Portugal, since the 1970s. Aides say the trip is a key opportunity for the pope to renew appeals enshrined in his 2015 encyclical ""Laudato Si"" on environmental protection. ""CLIMATE EMERGENCY"" Francis challenged governments on Sunday to take ""drastic measures"" to combat global warming and reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world was experiencing a climate emergency. In Madagascar, the world's fourth-largest island, about 44 per cent of forests have disappeared over the past 60 years, according to the French agricultural research centre CIRAD. The environmental danger there is aggravated because 80per cent of its plant and animal species are not found anywhere else. Poverty and corruption will also loom large. According to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), 80 per cent of Mozambique's population of about 30 million cannot afford the minimum costs for an adequate diet. The WFP says more than 90per cent of Madagascar's population of 26 million live on less than US$2 a day and that chronic child malnutrition is widespread. Francis has called for a fairer distribution of wealth between prosperous and developing countries, and defended the right of countries to control their mineral resources. He has branded corruption ""one of the most decimating plagues"" in society. Mozambique and Madagascar rank in the lowest quarter of Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. ""Corruption is huge. Many Mozambicans have lost faith completely in their political leaders,"" said Dahl-Bredine. Francis makes an eight-hour stop in Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean that is relatively rich compared Madagascar and Mozambique. But anti-poverty campaigners say Mauritius' tax treaties and financial services industry facilitate tax avoidance, draining desperately-needed revenues from poor countries."""
"Germany, land of the car, develops taste for electric cargo bikes",04 Sep 2019 02:05AM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/germany--land-of-the-car--develops-taste-for-electric-cargo-bikes-11870254," BERLIN: Think tricycles for the age of global warming: A rising number of environmentally conscious Germans are buying electric cargo bikes, which last year outsold electric cars in a country known for its love of the combustion engine. Climate change is the top concern for Germans, opinion polls show, but government subsidies to boost sales of electric cars have not gained traction. Only 36,000 electric cars were sold in Germany last year, compared with 25,000 in 2017, according to motor vehicle authority KBA. The picture is much rosier for electric cargo bikes, three-wheeled vehicles that have a motor to help with pedalling and a large cargo basket that can fit kids, pets and shopping and so make them popular with parents. The Two-Wheel Industry Association (ZIV) keeps data on the machines and says 40,000 were sold last year, almost twice as many as in 2017. I think Germans have realised, especially in cities like Berlin and Frankfurt that a cargo bike can replace a second car,"" said ZIV head Siegfried Neuberger. ""You can use it to go shopping, you can take the kids to daycare and so it's very practical, environment-friendly, sustainable and healthy, which makes it very attractive to Germans,"" he added. It was such attributes that prompted Karen Lebek, a water security researcher at the Humboldt University who lives with her husband and two daughters on a leafy street in southwest Berlin to buy an electric cargo bike. ""It makes everything easy,"" said Lebek, carefully placing a bag of apples from a street fruit vendor next to her 4-year-old daughter in the basket. ""You can go wherever you want without having to worry about parking,"" she added. ""The kids love it because they can just hop in and out and they can bring friends along because the cargo basket fits four children."" Lebek and her husband now plan to sell their seven-seater car and will rely on the electric bike, bought for 2,500 euros (US$2,786), for their transport. (US$1 "
On the front lines of climate change in the world's northernmost town,03 Sep 2019 08:27PM,Reuters/zl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/on-the-front-lines-of-climate-change-in-the-world-s-northernmost-town-11869542," SVALBARD, Norway: Icebergs float liked doomed islands past the small boat as it makes its way through a fjord filled with the slush of a melting glacier. Occasionally, as the warming waters dissolve the bottom of one of the icebergs, it becomes top-heavy and does a somersault, as if it were playing instead of dying. The Wahlenberg glacier above the fjord naturally calves, sheering off icebergs into the water. But here it is happening at an increasing rate because of warming waters, says Kim Holmen, the international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute.   Holmen, wearing a woollen hat with a hot-pink pom-pom against the chill of an Arctic summer day, has lived in the northern Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard for three decades. He describes the changes he's seen as profound, large and rapid."" ""We are losing the Svalbard we know. We are losing the Arctic as we know it because of climate change,"" he says amid the constant crackle and trickle of the ice dissolving. ""This is a forewarning of all the hardship and problems that will spread around the planet.""   Since 1970, average annual temperatures have risen by 4 degrees Celsius in Svalbard, with winter temperatures rising more than 7 degrees, according to a report released by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Services in February. The ""Climate in Svalbard 2100"" report also warns that the annual mean air temperature in Svalbard is projected to increase by 7 to 10 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Since 1979, the Arctic sea ice extent has declined by nearly 12 per cent per decade, with the most pronounced winter reduction in the Svalbard and Barents Sea area. That's not good news for Svalbard's main town, Longyearbyen. With a population of slightly more than 2,000 people, it is the northernmost town on the planet. It is also the fastest-warming. A GRAVEYARD IN HARM'S WAY Rows of simple white wooden crosses cling to a hillside over Longyearbyen, a sparse cemetery that appears vulnerable even on a sunny day in August. Ivar Smedsroed is the summer vicar at Svalbard Church, a red wooden building with white trim and a weathervane-topped bell tower. Inside the Lutheran house of worship, which claims to be the world's northernmost church, stained glass paints the snow-topped mountains nearby in a pastel hue.   The pastor has only been here for the summer, but in that short time he has already learned of people's fears about the effects of a rapidly changing climate. One such effect is a thawing of the permafrost beneath his feet at the graveyard, which he calls ""a place of memories, a place of remembrance.""   ""As the permafrost thaws, things that are in the ground tend to be pulled up,"" Smedsroed says matter-of-factly as he sits on the ground near the graves. ""That is happening more or less all of the time, so we might see that the graves literally come up, the coffins."" There has been talk of relocating the graveyard after a landslide missed wiping it out by meters in October 2016. Nearly three years later, slabs of rock form a slash in the landscape just beyond the graves. ""Because of climate change and the difference that makes to the soil and the ground, some of the graves that we see behind us might end up actually sliding into the road,"" says Smedsroed, whose gray hair matches the woolen sweater beneath his white collar. ""Or the next thing that we could see is that they might all be covered in the next big landslide coming down the hill."" AVALANCHES AND THE ABYSS Thawing permafrost isn't just a problem for the dead: It has caused problems for current residents of Longyearbyen too. Houses in the valley are built on small wooden stilts instead of deep foundations. Softening ground can lead to collapses, landslides and avalanches, and the houses here are no match for them. On Dec 19, 2015, an avalanche killed a man and a child in their homes. ""It was the middle of the night, and nobody knew what was coming,"" Longyearbyen resident Anna Boegh says near the site where the houses once stood.   ""This was thought to be an incredibly uncommon event, but two years after, in 2017, there was another avalanche, says her partner, Erik Holmund. No one died in that avalanche, but several houses were swept away. Erosion also threatens homes here. Three years ago, as winter approached, 13m of coastline fell away overnight, leaving Christiane Huebner's cabin perilously close to the fjord. Huebner, her family of three and their husky dogs abandoned the home. ""It was a wake-up call since it happened very quickly,"" she says. They returned the following spring and had to relocate the cabin 80m from the shore. The ground beneath Svalbard has proven deadly elsewhere. Wieslaw Sawicki's son Michal worked as a geophysicist at the Polish Polar Research Station in Hornsund on the southern side of Svalbard. The Polish scientist and meteorologist Anna Górska died when they fell from a mountain in May.   Michal, 44, was an experienced mountaineer, scientist and explorer on his fifth stint for the institute in the Arctic. Founded in 1957, it conducts year-round research and is the northernmost permanent Polish scientific institution. ""Unfortunately, there was a huge snow cornice which looked like it was part of the peak of the mountain,"" says Sawicki, who was visiting Longyearbyen last month to meet with the governor of the archipelago. ""It collapsed with them; they both fell into the abyss."" He talks about how Michal would send letters home to Poland talking about the beauty of Svalbard. ""He would interestingly describe the changes that were happening here, how the glaciers were melting, how during each stay you could see the temperature rising and how the natural environment was changing,"" he adds, holding back tears. A SLEDDER WORRIES ABOUT HIS DOGS The spectre of climate change looms large over Audun Salte's dog farm. The Norwegian owns Svalbard Husky with his wife, Mia. When the dogs in the yard see Salte, they excitedly jump up, hoping to go out for a run. During the summer, with no snow on the ground, the dogs pull sleds on wheels along the bumpy gravel road, rattling past the few cars on the island.   Salte worries that as temperatures warm, climate change could lead to the extinction of all life on Earth. A man who likes kissing and dancing with his dogs – he has 110 of them – he's concerned most about the nonhumans on the planet. ""If climate change should be the end of humanity, I really don't care, but if climate change is the end of any animal species who hasn't contributed anything towards the speeding up of this process, that's why I am reacting,"" he says.   Gesturing with a nod toward his dogs, he says: ""It's just unfair to anyone that doesn't have a say in what is happening – the dogs, seals or polar bears or birds in the sky. That's why it is unfair, and that is why we should do something."" He compares climate change to an accident that we can't help staring at, feeling lucky we weren't the victim: ""When people slow down to look at a car crash, climate change is like that because everyone is slowing down to look at the accident but not realizing that we are actually the car crash."""""
US presidential candidate Booker proposes US$3 trillion climate change plan,03 Sep 2019 06:14PM,Reuters/ad,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/us-presidential-candidate-booker-proposes-us-3-trillion-climate-change-plan-11869086," NEW YORK: US presidential hopeful Cory Booker unveiled a US$3 trillion plan to address climate change on Tuesday (Sep 3), vowing to reach a 100 per cent clean energy economy by 2045 by sharply curbing fossil fuels while investing heavily in renewable energy sources. The plan also calls for a new White House-coordinated Environmental Justice Fund"" that would focus on defending at-risk communities from environmental threats, including a nationwide lead remediation program to replace all lead water pipes for schools and residences. Booker's home of Newark, New Jersey, where he served as mayor for seven years, has been grappling with lead contamination in its water supply in recent weeks. ""We are facing a dual crisis of climate change and economic inequality,"" Booker said. ""Without immediate action, we risk an incredible human toll from disasters, health impacts, rising national security threats, and trillions of dollars in economic losses."" Booker, 50, has lagged behind the front-runners, including former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow US senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He is among the 10 candidates – out of a field of 20 – who qualified for the third Democratic debate this month in Houston. The 10 candidates are also set to appear on Wednesday on CNN at back-to-back town halls focused on climate change. Along with several other candidates, Booker has previously supported the Green New Deal, a Democratic-backed congressional resolution that calls for net-zero emissions by 2030 but is more of a statement of ideals than a specific legislative plan. President Donald Trump, a Republican and climate change skeptic, has announced plans to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement that aims to limit global warming and has rolled back environmental regulations he says are bad for the economy. Booker said he would impose a carbon tax on natural gas, coal and oil producers and return some of the revenue to Americans via a monthly dividend, though his campaign did not offer specific figures. Several lawmakers from both parties have introduced versions of a fee-and-dividend system in Congress, though none of the bills appear likely to pass. The proposal includes several executive actions that Booker would take as president, including barring new offshore and onshore fossil fuel leases, requiring all new passenger vehicles be zero-emission starting in 2030 and requiring fossil fuel companies to stop all methane leaks. Booker also offered legislative reforms that would face a tough road in Congress, such as ending all fossil fuel subsidies; investing billions of dollars in energy storage, clean energy and electric vehicles; phasing out fracking; and banning fossil fuel exports by 2030. In addition to lead remediation, the Environmental Justice Fund would clean up every abandoned coal, uranium and hard rock mine in the country, plant 100 million trees in urban areas and ensure all households have adequate plumbing, all moves Booker said would help low-income and minority communities that are hardest hit by environmental problems."""
China's 'Belt and Road' risks Paris climate goals: Analysis,02 Sep 2019 09:28AM (Updated: 02 Sep 2019 10:13AM),AFP/nr,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-bri-belt-road-climate-change-risk-paris-goals-analysis-11863318," PARIS: Carbon-heavy development in countries part of China's Belt and Road Initiative could render the Paris climate goals unreachable, according to a new analysis on the gargantuan global infrastructure project released Monday (Sep 2). The massive network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks spanning Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe will see trillions invested in new infrastructure across 126 countries. While the Chinese state is putting up a significant part of the cash, the project will also see other national and private-sector investment, and opponents warn of its devastating environmental impact.   An analysis of the possible carbon footprint of infrastructure development in Belt and Road (BRI) countries said there was a significant risk of the initiative alone producing enough greenhouse gas emissions to derail the Paris climate goals. The 2015 accord enjoins nations to cap temperature rises to well below"" two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Tsinghua Center for Finance and Development said that the 126 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries excluding China currently account for 28 per cent of manmade emissions. It modelled the effects of different approaches to the development of megaports, pipelines, train lines and highways in 17 BRI countries. It found that countries such as Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia would need to lower carbon emissions 68 per cent by 2050 compared to current trajectories in order to keep the world on course to two degrees Celsius of warming. ""We have a business-as-usual scenario that says if you continue the way you are then even if every other country on the planet - which includes US, Europe, China and India - goes on a two degrees Celsius pathway, this is still going to blow the carbon budget,"" said Simon Zadek, senior visiting fellow at the Tsinghua Center. ""The BRI growth dynamic is so large that if you get the carbon (emissions) wrong in a way it doesn't matter anymore what anyone else does.""   The report said emissions by 2050 from all BRI countries could be 39 per cent lower if they followed industrial ""best practice"" by employing greener technology. POLICY CONSISTENCY China - the world's top carbon polluter - currently produces around 30 per cent of manmade CO2, although on a per capita basis its emissions are roughly on a par with Europe. Beijing has been praised with taking strong action on domestic air pollution but has come in for criticism for its fossil fuel investment outside of China. Zadek said that China needed to have ""policy consistency"" with regards to emissions, both at home and abroad in BRI nations. The United Nations estimates that two thirds of the world's 2050 infrastructure has yet to be built. Zadek said the BRI was an opportunity for the world to decarbonise while expanding trade and growth opportunities. He suggested establishing an international platform to support green finance initiatives across BRI countries, as well as applying mandatory environmental assessments for Chinese investments in the project. ""Is it easy? Can we do it by tomorrow morning by 9 o'clock? Of course not,"" he said. ""But we've taken care to set out what each pathway would look like. It can be done."" The Tsinghua analysis was co-authored by Vivid Economics and the ClimateWorks Foundation."""
Pope urges politicians to take 'drastic measures' on climate change,01 Sep 2019 06:58PM,Reuters,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-urges-politicians-to-take--drastic-measures--on-climate-change-11862168," VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis challenged governments on Sunday (Sep 1) to take drastic measures"" to combat global warming and reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world was experiencing a climate emergency. Francis issued his appeal, a written message for Sunday's World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, ahead of the United Nations Climate Action Summit this month in New York, a follow up to the 2016 Paris Agreement to curb global warming. Calling the UN summit ""of particular importance,"" he added: ""There, governments will have the responsibility of showing the political will to take drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the average increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius with respect to pre-industrial levels, in accordance with the Paris Agreement goals."" Francis has made many calls for environmental protection and has clashed over climate change with sceptics leaders such as US President Donald Trump, who has taken the United States out of the Paris accord. ""We have caused a climate emergency that gravely threatens nature and life itself, including our own,"" the leader of the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics said in the message for the prayer day, which is marked by various Christian Churches. ""Our prayers and appeals are directed first at raising the awareness of political and civil leaders,"" he said, adding that governments should ""renew commitments decisive for directing the planet towards life, not death"". He listed constant pollution, continued use of fossil fuels, intensive agricultural exploitation and deforestation as being among the man-made causes of global warming and said the Amazon, where fires are raging, is ""gravely threatened"". ""Now is the time to abandon our dependence on fossil fuels and move, quickly and decisively, towards forms of clean energy and a sustainable and circular economy,"" he said. Other phenomena, such as the melting of glaciers and the presence of plastic and microplastics in the oceans ""testify to the urgent need for interventions that can no longer be postponed,"" he said. ""Egoism and self-interest have turned creation, a place of encounter and sharing, into an arena of competition and conflict,"" he said. Francis, who wrote an encyclical in 2015 on environmental protection, said now was the time for people to reflect on their lifestyles, urging them not to make ""thoughtless and harmful"" decisions"" on food, consumption and transportation. ""Too many of us act like tyrants with regard to creation,"" he said. Protection of the environment is expected to be a main theme of the pope's trip to Africa, which starts on Wednesday."""
Commentary: Climate action is our generation’s 1965,01 Sep 2019 06:02AM (Updated: 01 Sep 2019 01:20PM),CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-action-is-singapore-generation-1965-challenge-11857018," SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong this National Day Rally publicly acknowledged climate change as an existential threat to Singapore – and aced it. He unflinchingly positioned the threat dead-centre in the Singaporean psyche – and mentioned housing price risks in the East Coast and waterfront areas. Yet, he also managed to sound upbeat and forward-looking. This marks the defining moment for Singapore’s climate war. It is a clarion call for us to understand the climate impact reverberating through our society, economy and geopolitics. Singapore’s Total Defence strategy surely welcomes its missing seventh pillar. WHY WE MUST At “just” 1.1 degrees Celsius increase in warming, climate change will cost millions of lives and homes, lead to acidic oceans challenging sealife, droughts, floods, heatwaves ravaging crop yields, as well as mosquitoes reproducing faster and propagating Zika, dengue and other pandemics. Our Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) climate analysis last year, recommended 4 degrees Celsius warming as the baseline planning parameter going forward, different from the 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius future discussed then. It was a tough call that endangered our credibility, but the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vindicated our prediction months later, leveraging 200 scientists over two years. Singapore’s economy has a carbon bent. We emitted 50.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2014, 27th highest among 142 countries. Studies have shown if everyone lived like Singaporeans, the amount of resources the Earth produces in 2018 would have been used up by Apr 2018.   The paradigm shift required to save our homeland and the world, offers exciting opportunities in green growth. Global heating will transform the destinies of most countries and companies, on par with Artificial Intelligence. YES WE CAN PM Lee declared that everything must “bend at the knee” to protect our homeland, and that we do not want our descendants ashamed of us. Our implemented mitigation measures already ensure that we overachieve our promised Nationally Determined Contributions of reducing emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. Kudos to our civil servants. With PM Lee affirming that “Singapore must do its part”, will we raise our ambition? Forty-nine countries, representing 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have capped emissions, while 10 countries will reach net zero by 2050. Optimal mitigation requires the Government, corporates and all individuals doing our utmost. Collaborating with the global community to constrain emissions while protecting carbon-rich rainforests is crucial. A circular economy can almost halve global industry emissions by 2050. Sustainable finance will mushroom, from SWFs and other smart investors divesting fossil fuels and others with carbon exposure, to protect financial returns. Singapore as a global financial hub should accelerate efforts to leverage and support the essential global transition to a clean, decarbonised economy. Investors and companies that protect the planet, while catering to lives worth living, will be rewarded.   An Asian SWF sustainability executive told me they plan to become carbon-neutral next year, and recommended each corporate devise a carbon-neutral strategy. Climate literacy will support boards in understanding the new climate economy, as fundamental to fiduciary duty. The carbon intensity of industries, and the carbon differential within sectors, will shape the competitive landscape and economy. The top 10 per cent of households in rich countries such as the US, consumed four to five times more carbon on average compared to the bottom half, in Oxfam’s analysis. That bears consideration in our tax policy. I have six suggestions on how to re-engineer Singapore for that greener future. 1. HOW ABOUT CHEAPER COES TO DRIVE ELECTRIC MOBILITY? A car is our largest carbon purchase, if one flies less than one Singapore-London return trip annually. Cheaper Electric Vehicles (EVs), with well-distributed and bookable charging infrastructure, can equalise the playing field. Though EVs here burn fossil fuels and are not zero emission, they remain a cleaner alternative. Property developers that support our national imperative, could incorporate charging spots in their buildings. We can reciprocate with more Greenmark points. 2. HOW ABOUT CHEAPER, MORE RELIBALE PUBLIC TRANSPORT? The wider the differential between holistic public transportation costs and private car ownership, the more people would lower their carbon footprint. Our Smart Nation prowess can support by improving the accuracy of bus arrival predictions and journey duration.   Design thinking, with better traffic light algorithms, could rebalance the time cost, heat stress and inconvenience borne by pedestrians and public transit users. 3. LET’S STOP WASTING FOOD We can all do this, by buying the right portions and storing it well. Supermarkets should sell perishables in small portions so that consumers do not overpurchase. The Government can consider policies such as France’s law banning supermarkets from dumping food, a Good Samaritan Law shielding F&B donors from liability, and research into cold chain management best-practices. 4. MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT BUILDINGS Construction is one of the biggest emitters. Architects and property developers are hence key partners in Singapore’s climate war. Given the gap between Singapore’s carbon tax and IPCC’s recommendation, judicious boards and management may choose to future-proof their business models amid different global carbon tax scenarios, but it’s worth reviewing our carbon tax rate. A key test of Singapore’s climate conviction, is frigid office temperatures in our tropical country. Does our involuntary chill stem from cheap, poorly-functioning air-conditioners that cannot circulate cold air around the entire floor properly? So they blast frigid air to ensure it remains cold when it reaches the furthest person? Whatever it is, our failure to have sane temperatures strains the credibility of our climate change fight. Solar panel windows can help address our lack of surface area for installations, while reducing the buildings’ net carbon footprint. Otherwise, we should use at least insulated windows to minimise cooling needed.   The future of energy is decarbonised, distributed and digital. Locating power generators closer to users reduces the significant 30 per cent energy transmission loss. With solar power offering deployment at various capacities, is this not viable for Singapore? 5. EMBRACE RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION Production and shipping to Singapore incur carbon costs, every step of the way. Those who shop as if there is no tomorrow will indeed lead us to having no tomorrow. Consuming fewer, quality and durable products would reduce the strain on our Earth. Singapore’s average per capita emission was about double that of small, rich nations such as Denmark and Switzerland. Wildfires are ravaging our world. While we are not the ones burning the Amazon, or abetting farmers, our clamour for Brazilian pork, beef and soy effectively endorses the burning. Platform giants could help with filters for the relative carbon intensity of each product type. 6. CHOOSE FUEL-EFFICIENT APPLIANCES These often help you save money over its lifecycle. The National Environment Agency's app has a great fuel-efficiency function for key energy sinks. Corporates could support by sourcing quality, energy-efficient appliances. CALL TO ACTION Concerned for us? Discuss global heating with your friends. Discover your carbon footprint, and support our future at the SG Climate Rally in September.   Global heating strikes at humanity’s Achilles’ heel. The top risk to our planet for this generation carries implications that make it painful to understand and address, turbocharged by the tragedy of the commons. Yet, this is our watch. Whether the scales fell from our eyes at or before NDR, we must act now to constrain carbon emissions. How can we sell our next generation into carbon debt? So run a carbon-neutral company, fly less, and eat less (meat)? The choice is yours, and your action matters. On that, hangs the fate of Singapore and our world. Vivian Claire Liew is a global sustainability expert and CEO of PhilanthropyWorks, which advises leading investors and corporates on the new climate economy."
Commentary: Climate change in Singapore and what the future brings,31 Aug 2019 06:02AM (Updated: 31 Aug 2019 06:10AM),CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-in-singapore-outlook-floods-haze-warming-11841934," SINGAPORE: During his recent National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted that the defence against climate change must be given as much emphasis as the military defence provided by the Singapore Armed Forces because climate change threatens the existence of our nation in the 21st century. Many Singaporeans who have paid only cursory attention to environmental issues may be surprised by the gravity of this message. Sure, there are the occasional flash floods and yes, we do remember the days when the island was shrouded in haze. But have we come to the point where the climate has turned into such a monstrosity that our city-state has to “go to war” against this gargantuan enemy for generations ahead? Two aspects of the problem help us appreciate our nation’s long-term commitment to mitigate and adapt to climate change. First, the observation and scientific understanding of climate change, especially how headline global trends compare in relation to Singapore. Second, the rational basis for addressing other suspected effects of climate change.   WHEN CLIMATE CHANGE WAS KNOWN AS GLOBAL WARMING Do you recall when climate change was known mainly as global warming? That was because rising temperatures were the earliest signal to be detected. The world’s average surface temperature has been rising since the first Industrial Revolution, with a rate of increase of 0.1 degree Celsius per decade from 1950 onwards. For Singapore, the warming was twice as fast because land heats up more easily than the sea and urbanisation replaced self-cooling vegetation with heat-retaining concrete buildings and bitumen roads. The top 10 hottest years in Singapore since 1950 all occurred within the last 22 years. The elevated temperature baseline brought on by the combined effects of excessive greenhouse gases and urbanisation led to the observed clustering of the hottest years. This means that Singaporeans are more at risk than ever from heat illnesses, like heat exhaustion. STRESS ON WATER SUPPLIES IN 2015 Two of the hottest years, 1997 and 2015, are also respectively the driest and second driest years in Singapore on record, from data that dates back to 1869. These years witnessed strong El Nino events whereby the central equatorial Pacific Ocean is unusually warm and attract convective clouds and rain away from Southeast Asia, leading to intensified solar heating and drought in this region. Global warming added to the strength of the naturally occurring El Nino, with significant impact on our region.   Three districts in neighbouring Johor underwent water-rationing in August to September 2015, affecting more than 640,000 industrial and household consumers for a month. In Singapore, the desalination and NEWater plants under Public Utilities Board increased freshwater production to tide us over, so few people noticed the water shortage. EXPOSURE TO HAZE But water supply was not the only challenge we faced that year. We were sitting ducks for the transboundary haze that hit us repeatedly from late August to end October. The 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) broke 300 and stayed in the Hazardous range for several hours on Sep 25, 2015. Schools were closed that day to minimise our children’s exposure to the unhealthy air. The haze was produced by man-made forest fires in Sumatra made worse by the hot, dry weather. Many Singaporeans would recall a severe haze episode similarly aggravated by El Nino back in Oct 1997. The sombre realisation is that hot, dry years are becoming more often because of climate change.   RISING SEA LEVELS The past is a guide but let’s look at the future and what could impact us most. The science underlying climate change is easy to grasp. We learnt as a kid that things expand when heated. The ocean is no exception: Global warming has caused the upper ocean to increase its volume, raising the mean sea level. This rise is exacerbated by melting ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica as well as glaciers around the world. Tidal gauges in Singapore Strait and Johor Strait show our local sea level has risen at a rate of 2 to 4 cm per decade in the last 25 years. The rate of increase will accelerate as the world burns more fossil fuels to provide energy. The carbon dioxide gas emitted enhances downward infrared radiation at the surface, akin to using infrared lamps to keep food warm, except that we overdo the warming by our incessant consumption of the non-renewable energy. By 2100, Singapore may experience between half to 1m of mean sea level rise, according to the Second National Climate Change Study published by Meteorological Services Singapore. It’s no wonder the threat of coastal inundation posed by rising sea levels was a key issue PM Lee raised last week.   UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WHEN CLIMATE CHANGES Still, there are open questions about climate change that science has not answered or cannot answer. Here are two examples that impact Singapore: How the frequency, intensity and duration of tropical storms like Sumatra squalls would change is still unknown. How Aedes mosquitoes which transmit dengue would breed in a changing climate is a matter of research. The “tipping point” beyond which the world’s climate is irreversibly altered is hard to quantify as a threshold on a measureable index. Future warming also depends on the global collective decision on energy production and consumption, the latter contributed much by urban centres like Singapore. This is an indeterministic problem at the core. So climate scientists cannot foretell which climate-change scenario the Earth will follow or map out all the details. But should these uncertainties hold us back from action? The rational response to meet grave risks arising from uncertainty is to “purchase insurance”, like the way we protect our loved ones in buying life policies. For a nation, “insurance” means coordinated mitigation and adaptation policies. For example, the Ministry of Finance introduced this year the carbon tax to dis-incentivise greenhouse gas emissions. The Ministry of Environment and Water Resources has planned for a second pump house at the Marina Barrage to reduce flash-flood risk during a thunderstorm for low-lying areas of central Singapore.   The fact is ironically in 2015, the second driest year on record, on Dec 10 and 11, heavy downpours brought flash floods to Kallang and Boon Lay areas. This is the kind of unpredictable risks that we seek to defend ourselves against when we face a changing climate in Singapore. There is still time but the stakes are high. We have to act now.

"Less waste, greener skies: Reducing the environmental impact of flying",31 Aug 2019 06:02AM (Updated: 31 Aug 2019 03:59PM),CNA/co,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-airlines-green-sustainable-less-waste-plastic-11808518," SINGAPORE: If you’re a regular flier with Singapore Airlines (SIA), you may have noticed that salt and pepper packets are no longer included in the meal trays served in economy class. In fact, the airline removed salt, pepper and sugar packets in November 2018. This is one of the many initiatives taken by the carrier to contribute to “greener skies” by reducing food wastage on board and cut back on the use of in-flight items, a company spokesman told CNA in response to queries. “SIA has embarked on many new initiatives in the last financial year to continue offering our customers the best travel experience while operating more sustainably,” the spokesman said. The carrier is also taking steps to reduce single-use plastics and replace them with more sustainable materials.   Those travelling in business class are still offered the condiments, as these are served in shakers instead of disposable packets. That is not to say passengers in economy class don’t have to miss out on that extra kick of flavour - salt and pepper are still available, but passengers need to ask for the packets. This is not the only environmental initiative that SIA has brought in. “We aim to become entirely plastic straw-free this financial year,” the spokesman said. “During the last financial year, we began the process of removing plastic straws onboard, and the remaining, children’s straws, are to be substituted with environmentally friendly paper straws by September 2019.” Becoming more sustainable is not an uncommon move in the aviation industry. The Qantas Group, which includes Jetstar Asia, announced a plan in February to become the first airline to cut 100 million single-use plastics by the end of 2020 and eliminate at least three-quarters of its general waste by the end of 2021.  For a start, Qantas Airways operated what it said was the “world's first zero waste flight” on May 8 from Sydney to Adelaide, with all in-flight products reused or recycled, or disposed of through composting. AirAsia claims to be the only airline in Malaysia to perform onboard cabin recycling since 2015, where recyclable items are handed over to certified recycling partners after every flight. Everybody is cognisant of the benefit of aviation but we also have to be mindful of all the risks we create, and that's why airlines all over the world have come very strong in promoting sustainability efforts,"" said AirAsia's group head of global affairs and sustainability Shasha Ridzam. SAVING THE EARTH OR JUST A PR STUNT? But given that aviation is responsible for two per cent of global man-made carbon emissions, is there such a thing as a “green flight”? While experts agree that these initiatives are a step in the right direction, they can be a distraction from the bigger picture. “It can be hard to know from the outside whether these efforts are in done earnest or if the companies are greenwashing,” said Assistant Professor Sonny Ben Rosenthal at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. Greenwashing is a term used to describe businesses that implement strategies designed to create a false impression about their environmental credentials. “Waste minimisation is a good one to choose from a PR standpoint because it is relatively easy to implement and show to the public. It’s like the anti-straw movement. When consumers bring their own straws to drink from plastic cups with plastic lids, they’ve still wasted a lot of plastic.” But with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projecting air travel to double in the next 20 years, regional aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz of Maybank Kim Eng said that “there simply is no better alternative for the moment"". “Would anyone want to take a train from Europe to Asia as it is purported to be the most environmentally least impactful? I don’t think so,” he said. “The only real thing for airlines to do really is to buy the latest aircraft model there is, because it has the best fuel efficiency and lowest carbon footprint. But that is not always possible because of the long aircraft lifecycle.”   A report published in March from the London School of Economics (LSE) suggests that twenty of the world’s largest airlines do not have strategies in place to help meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degree Celsius in the long term. None of the twenty airlines has a target that clearly specifies how it will reduce its own flight emissions after 2025. The report also says that only the UK's EasyJet is meeting those aviation targets so far, with companies named as having the weakest plans to cut emissions including Air China, China Southern, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines. However, there are some limitations to the LSE research, as pointed out by Korean Airlines in a BBC article. It doesn’t take into account that some airlines carry much more baggage and freight than others. In response to queries on its efforts to cut down on carbon emissions, SIA said that the average age of its fleet is “just over six years”, which allows them to benefit from new, fuel-efficient technology. “In addition, SIA has since 2011 been an active member of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which was established to accelerate the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels,” the company spokesman told CNA. “SIA sees sustainable aviation fuel as a long-term measure to support the aviation industry’s carbon-neutral growth goal beyond 2020.” THE FLIGHT SHAMING MOVEMENT Meanwhile, an anti-flying movement is catching on in Europe. Fueled by activists in Sweden, “flygskam” which translates to “flight shame” is the name of the movement which encourages people to stop taking flights to lower carbon emissions.   On Wednesday (Aug 29), 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg arrived in Manhattan after a two-week journey on a zero-emissions sailboat to take part in a United Nations summit. The two-week journey from Britain to New York would have taken just eight hours by flight - but she refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions generated by the aviation industry. SHOULD AIRLINES BE CONCERNED? Although anti-flying campaigns have yet to generate mass interest, environmental activist and founder of Green Drinks Singapore Oliva Choong said that this is something that airlines should keep an eye on: “While this group may be small right now, there is a need to cater to concerns towards the climate because it is a pressing issue that their existing customers feel or may do so with greater environmental awareness.” “SIA's biofuel flights are a step in a greener direction although there is still a large amount of carbon emissions generated through flying,” she added. SIA launched its first biofuel flight in May 2017. The flights are powered by a combination of hydro-processed esters and fatty acids, a sustainable biofuel produced from used cooking oils, and conventional jet fuel. “Aviation companies should adopt greener practices because it's the right thing to do, and in some cases, it will save them money in the long run,"" said Ms Choong.   Echoing this, Flightglobal's Asia managing editor Greg Waldron said: “Airlines have always been talking about and looking at ways of cutting fuel and thereby cutting emissions because fuel is a significantly big cost. “They have a very real economic incentive to reduce the amount of fuel that they consume simply because that's where their profitability comes in.” He pointed out that governments and regulators can also have a hand in this. “When there's major (air) traffic and planes have to circle over the airport for twenty to thirty minutes because of congestion, that's wasting a lot of fuel that doesn't need to be wasted.” Ultimately, while “flight-shaming” remains confined to Europe, air travel may come increasingly under the spotlight regarding its negative environmental impact. “If it’s a movement that was to gain momentum, I think airlines will be very concerned about it,” said Mr Waldron. “They have to recognise that there's certainly a sentiment out there and that's why you're seeing this.”"""
"As fall begins in Alaska, wildfires linked to warming rage on",30 Aug 2019 01:09PM,Reuters/zl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/as-fall-begins-in-alaska--wildfires-linked-to-warming-rage-on-11856300," SEWARD: Leaves in Alaska are changing colour and the rainy season is supposed to begin, but wildfires are raging on in an unusually long and fierce fire season that scientists say is linked to the far north's long-term climate warmup. Usually, Alaska wildfires wind down by late July, but this week, the state Department of Natural Resources extended the official fire season to Sep 30. Last week, Governor Mike Dunleavy declared state emergencies for fires burning north and south of Anchorage. The most serious blaze is the Swan Lake Fire on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage, which had grown to more than 64,750 hectares by Thursday (Aug 29) and the 31,335 hectare McKinley Fire north of Anchorage.   Billowing smoke from the Swan Lake Fire has sent particulate pollution levels in the Kenai Peninsula to some of the worst measured anywhere in the world. Ignited by an early June lightning strike, the fire has snarled traffic and nearly shut down tourism in an area famous for its outdoor recreation. In the port town of Seward, thick smoke blowing south from the Swan Lake fire blotted out the normally spectacular views of mountains and glaciers and forced cancellation of tourists' excursions. What can you do? Global warming,"" said Marlee Hernandez at Exit Glacier Tours in Seward. ""It's been kind of a botched summer,"" said Joe Drevets, who was working behind the counter at Seward's Sea Bean Cafe. The McKinley Fire has destroyed more than 130 structures, 51 of them primary homes, and displaced hundreds of people in the woodsy area, about 130km north of Anchorage. It was 71 per cent contained on Thursday and officials were allowing evacuated residents to return, but 560 firefighters remained on duty.   More than 200 Alaska fires remained active on Thursday, according to state and federal fire officials. In all, 684 fires have burned more than 1 million hectares in Alaska this year. Though far short of the record 2.7 million hectares burned in 2004, this year's fire total is part of a trend. Big fire years are more frequent as Alaska warms at a rate at least twice the global average. This is the 15th time in the past 80 years that more than 810,000 hectares burned in a single season, and six of those years have been since 2000, said Tim Mowry, a spokesman for the Alaska Division of Forestry. Especially remarkable are the ultra-dry and dangerous conditions in Alaska's most populous region, with some wildfires breaking out this summer even within city limits. ""I've been here 40 years, and this is the most extreme fire condition here that I can remember,"" said John See, a wildfire expert with the Anchorage Fire Department. Until this year, there had never been a ""severe drought"" declaration for Anchorage in the two-decade history of the US Drought Monitor. Anchorage and fire-stricken areas to the north and south of the city passed that threshold earlier this month and moved last week to the more serious ""extreme"" drought condition.   The fires are part of a summer of extremes in Alaska – record heat, lightning strikes in unlikely places, extraordinary meltdown of glaciers and widespread die-offs of animals, including whales, seals, birds and masses of pre-spawned salmon killed in waters with temperatures measured as high as 26.7 degrees Celsius. A late arrival of winter is almost a lock, said Brian Brettschneider, a climatologist with the University of Alaska Fairbank's International Arctic Research Center. ""Even if our temperatures turned on a dime, there's so much warmth in the water around Alaska that it is just going to take time for that to dissipate,"" Brettschnider said. After that, the winter ice that forms is likely to be thin, vulnerable to another early spring melt, leaving open waters to draw in more solar heat and feeding the warming cycle, he said."""
China CO2 emission targets at risk from US trade war: Official,30 Aug 2019 12:54PM (Updated: 30 Aug 2019 05:22PM),Reuters/zl/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-co2-emission-targets-at-risk-from-us-trade-war-official-11856920,"  BEIJING/SHANGHAI: China's greenhouse gas emission targets are at risk as a result of the trade war with the United States, which has put Beijing's coal-reliant economy under heavy pressure, a senior climate official said on Friday (Aug 30). External elements, such as the Sino-US trade war, have brought negative impacts and increasing uncertainties to the global economy, which has also made it more difficult for China to tackle climate change,"" said Li Gao, head of the climate change office at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The world's biggest producer of climate-warming greenhouse gases has pledged to bring emissions to a peak by around 2030 as part of the global effort to curb rising temperatures. It promised in June to show the ""highest possible ambition"" when reviewing its climate policies next year, raising hopes it would include more stringent targets in its 2021-2025 five-year plan. However, Li, briefing reporters ahead of a United Nations climate summit in New York next month, appeared to pour cold water on the idea China would be able to significantly accelerate efforts to bring emissions to a peak. ""Don't underestimate the determination and confidence of the Chinese government, but at the same time, don't underestimate the difficulties China is facing,"" he said, adding, ""China will not be able to meet the goal many years ahead of schedule."" China's policies are likely to come under scrutiny at the UN summit, especially after a summer of record-breaking temperatures across the globe. UN climate envoy Luis de Alba told Reuters earlier this month that the UN had received a ""positive response"" from China on ending investment in coal, a major source of greenhouse gas and air pollution. Li said the environment ministry would focus on climate financing in the future and work with the central bank and China's top planning body to devise policies to support carbon reduction projects throughout the country, including renewables and electric vehicles. But he said China still relied on fossil fuels and it was difficult to make adjustments, especially with the economy slowing. ""With the economy under downward pressure, the country has to take more measures to guarantee employment and the people's livelihood,"" he said. ""Some of those measures may not fit our effort to tackle climate change."" Li also said China was still unable to meet a major requirement of the Paris climate agreement to compile a full annual carbon inventory that should be submitted to the United Nations, as the country lacked staff and resources. China's last full inventory was for 2014, and measured the country's total emissions at 12.3 billion tonnes, up more than half in just a decade. An influential government think tank earlier called on China to impose a 2025 cap on carbon emissions, warning that on its current trajectory, the country's annual CO2 emissions would rise 30 per cent over the next decade."""
Ma vs Musk: Tech tycoons spar on future of AI,29 Aug 2019 03:43PM (Updated: 30 Aug 2019 12:18AM),AFP/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/jack-ma-vs-elon-musk-alibaba-tesla-future-of-ai-11853856," SHANGHAI: Jack Ma believes artificial intelligence poses no threat to humanity, but Elon Musk called that famous last words"" as the billionaire tech tycoons faced off Thursday (Aug 29) in an occasionally animated debate on futurism in Shanghai. The Chinese co-founder of Alibaba and the maverick industrialist behind Tesla and SpaceX frequently pulled pained expressions and raised eyebrows as they kicked off an AI conference with a dialogue that challenged attendees to keep up, veering from technology to Mars, death, and jobs. However, the hot topic in the hour-long talk was AI, which has provoked increasing concern among scientists such as late British cosmologist Stephen Hawking who warned that it will eventually turn on and ""annihilate"" humanity. ""Computers may be clever, but human beings are much smarter,"" Ma said. ""We invented the computer - I've never seen a computer invent a human being."" While insisting that he is ""not a tech guy,"" the e-commerce mogul added: ""I think AI can help us understand humans better. I don't think it's a threat."" Musk countered: ""I don't know man, that's like, famous last words."" He said the ""rate of advancement of computers in general is insane"", sketching out a vision in which super-fast, artificially intelligent devices eventually tire of dealing with dumb, slow humans. ""The computer will just get impatient if nothing else. It will be like talking to a tree,"" Musk said.   Mankind's hope lies in ""going along for the ride"" by harnessing some of that computing power, Musk said, as he offered an unabashed plug for his Neuralink Corporation. Neuralink aims to develop implantable brain-machine interface devices, which conjures images of ""The Matrix"", whose characters download software to their brains that instantly turns them into martial arts masters. ""Right now we are already a cyborg because we are so well-integrated with our phones and our computers,"" said Musk, 48. ""The phone is like an extension of yourself. If you forget your phone, its like a missing limb."" But humanity will also have more leisure time in the future as AI takes on much of the burden of transporting, feeding, and thinking for earthlings, said Ma. ""People could work as little as three days a week, four hours a day with the help of technology advances,"" he said. Ma, 54, who steps down next month as head of Alibaba Group, questioned Musk's push to develop spacecraft that could help us colonise Mars. ""We need a hero like you, but we need more heroes like us improving things on earth,"" Ma said. Musk countered that we must master interplanetary travel in case earth becomes uninhabitable. Scientists like Hawking have said the same, citing the risk of nuclear war, a devastating virus, global warming or asteroid collision. But not to worry: both agreed that human mortality is a good thing as each generation brings new ideas to the global challenges we face. ""It's great to die,"" Ma said, with Musk adding: ""That's probably true."""""
"High above Greenland glaciers, NASA looks into melting ocean ice",26 Aug 2019 06:17PM (Updated: 26 Aug 2019 06:20PM),AFP/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/high-above-greenland-glaciers-nasa-looks-into-melting-ocean-ice-11843272," GREENLAND: Skimming low over the gleaming white glaciers on Greenland's coast in a modified 1940s plane, three NASA scientists, led by an Elvis-impersonating oceanographer, waited to drop a probe into the water beneath them. They are part of Oceans Melting Greenland - or OMG - a mission that has flown around the vast island for four summers, dropping probes to collect data on how oceans contribute to the rapid melt of Greenland's ice. Dressed in a blue jumpsuit and with thick sideburns that give a hint of his occasional pastime impersonating Elvis, Joshua Willis, 44, is the oceanographer from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory behind the project - and, along with his wife, its name. We're looking at probably metres of sea level rise in the next hundred years and that's a huge threat to hundreds of millions of people around the world, so a bit of alarm and OMG is probably warranted,"" he said. Passing over rocky fjords, dazzling glaciers and icebergs, some dozens of metres (feet) high looming out of the water, Willis and the crew took turns dropping the 1.5m cylindrical probes and watching as the data came in showing the ocean's temperature and salinity. 'ICE CUBE UNDER A HAIR DRYER' Willis is investigating how warmer layers of water off the coast come into contact with glaciers and how this effects how quickly they melt. ""A lot of people think of the ice here as melting from the air warming, sort of like an ice cube under a hair dryer, but in fact the oceans are also eating away at the ice's edges,"" Willis said. OMG surveys Greenlandic glaciers in the winter, comparing it with the data they collect about the oceans in the summer over a five-year period, which Willis hopes will allow researchers to better predict sea-level rise. The island has three quarters bordering the Arctic ocean and is 85 percent covered in ice - if this ice sheet were to disappear completely, it would raise the ocean level by 7m (23 feet). The Arctic region has warmed twice as fast as the global average, and Greenland, a resource-rich Danish possession, has become a focal point for climate research - as well an object of desire for US President Donald Trump, who scrapped a trip to Denmark over its dismissal of his attempts to buy the autonomous territory. GREENLAND 'A CHALLENGE' NASA - best known for the moon landings and space travel - started to study the earth's climate in greater depth from the 1970s when its inter-planetary exploration budget was reduced, using its satellites to look at the earth. Today it has more than a dozen satellites in orbit monitoring earth's seas, ice, land and atmosphere, along with missions like OMG, which Willis hopes will provide data to give better predictions of sea-level rise around the globe. At the rear of the refitted DC3, built in 1942 for the Canadian air force during World War II, project manager Ian McCubbin took his turn by a chute holding the plastic probe, waiting for the order to drop it. Sucked out into the cold air below, the four-foot cylinder parachuted into the water and after a nervous wait, started transmitting data to the team on the plane. With 20 years' experience flying with the JPL, McCubbin also organises the mission's logistics from the remote airfields it flies out of during the summer. ""Dealing with Greenland's remoteness is a unique challenge,"" McCubbin said on a break between dropping probes, a baseball cap pulled down over his eyes. Limited communications and transport links and the island's unpredictable weather all make keeping the mission in the air more complicated, but McCubbin said he was happy to put up with the difficulties. ""The relevance of this project makes it exciting to work on, given the importance to our society, our children, our children's children,"" he said. 'TOUGH DECISIONS AHEAD' Ian Fenty, an investigator with OMG, sat in front of a laptop and a bank of electronics receiving the signals from the probes. After each probe hit the water, data started to upload almost immediately onto the small screen on the laptop on the tray table in front of Fenty. ""The data we're collecting are super valuable because they're allowing us for the very first time to quantitatively relate ocean temperature changes with the melting of the ice sheet,"" he said. After two hours in the air along the coast of eastern Greenland, the plane turned and headed back to base at the remote village of Kulusuk, flying low over icebergs and pods of whales in the sea below. After the flight, Willis, wearing Ray Bans, a leather jacket with the collar turned up and a guitar, gave a performance of his Elvis-inspired ""Climate Rock"" to diners and visiting journalists in the village's hotel, explaining the difference between the weather and climate. For Willis, the song, like his work with OMG, are all part of trying to get his message about climate change and sea-level rise across. ""I feel like as a climate scientist I have a responsibility to explain what we're finding to the world,"" he said. ""We have some tough decisions ahead of us if we want to avoid the worst parts of climate change."""""
Trump ready to meet Iranian president in potential breakthrough,26 Aug 2019 05:49PM (Updated: 27 Aug 2019 04:50AM),AFP/nh/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-ready-to-meet-iranian-president-in-potential-breakthrough-11843214," BIARRITZ: US President Donald Trump said on Monday (Aug 26) at the G7 summit that he is prepared to meet his Iranian counterpart within weeks in what would amount to a stunning change of direction in the two countries' smouldering standoff. The potential breakthrough was announced by Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he would facilitate the first face-to-face meeting between the US president and the Iranians. The surprise news came after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a dramatic, unscheduled appearance on the sidelines of the summit held in Biarritz on Sunday at the invitation of Macron. The 41-year-old French leader said the conditions for a meeting"" between Trump and Iran's Hassan Rouhani ""in the next few weeks"" had been created through intensive diplomacy and consultations. ""If the circumstances were correct, I would certainly agree to that,"" Trump said at a press conference with Macron at the end of three days of G7 talks. Asked if he thought the timeline proposed by his French counterpart was realistic, Trump replied: ""It does."" Trump was equally confident that Rouhani would be in favour. ""I think he's going to want to meet. I think Iran wants to get this situation straightened out,"" he added. Both men will be in New York for the UN General Assembly at the end of September which could provide the stage for the talks. Trump has put in place a policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran over its disputed nuclear programme via crippling sanctions that critics see as raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East between the United States and Iran. The US president last year unilaterally pulled out of a landmark 2015 international deal that placed limits on Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for trade, investment and sanctions relief. Trump said the deal gave the Iranians cover to keep pursuing a secret nuclear military programme which they insist does not exist. Rouhani appeared to accept the idea of opening to talks with Washington. ""I believe that for our country's national interests we must use any tool,"" Rouhani said of Zarif's Biarritz visit in a speech aired live on state television on Monday. But hardliners criticised the initiative, with the ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper saying the trip was ""improper"" and sent ""a message of weakness and desperation."" 'REAL PROGRESS' Macron has urged the US administration to offer some sort of relief to Iran, such as lifting sanctions on oil sales to China and India, and has raised the possibility of a new credit line to enable exports. In return, Iran would return to complying with the 2015 deal. Commenting on the talks about Iran at the G7, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""It's a big step forward. Now there is an atmosphere in which talks are welcomed."" Macron and Trump hailed the common ground found by G7 leaders at their summit, which was dominated by the Iranian nuclear crisis, global trade tensions and fires in the Amazon. ""We have managed to find real points of convergence, unprecedented, very positive, that will allow us to go forward in a very useful way,"" Macron told the press conference. Trump said Macron had done a ""fantastic job"" at the G7. ""This was a very special, a very unified two and a half days and I want to thank you,"" Trump told his host. Just a few weeks ago, Trump lambasted Macron for sending ""mixed signals"" on Iran, and at the end of July the US administration imposed sanctions on Zarif.   Macron acknowledged there had been ""nervousness"" ahead of the summit because of tensions between the US and Europe on a host of issues. ""A lot depends on the return to the United States of Donald Trump and the way he manages everything,"" analyst Thomas Gomart from the French foreign affairs think-tank IFRI told AFP. TRADE WAR WORRIES Commenting on his escalating trade war with China, Trump held out hope of a deal to thaw the bruising year-long dispute that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars' worth of goods by both sides. ""I can say we are having very meaningful talks, much more meaningful, I would say, than at any time,"" he had said at a press conference with Merkel. Trump said senior Chinese officials had been in contact, though there was no confirmation from the Chinese side. ""I'm not sure they have a choice (on making a deal),"" he said. ""I don't mean that as a threat. I don't think they have a choice."" Trump arrived in the famed surfing town of Biarritz on Saturday shortly after upping the ante in his trade war with a new round of increased tariffs on Chinese goods. European leaders have lined up to urge caution and warn about the danger of recession from the conflict. 'PRESERVE OUR LANDS' On the final day of the summit, the G7 agenda also included action to help fight fires destroying swaths of the Amazon. The members agreed to spend US$20 million (€18 million) on the world's biggest rainforest, mainly to send firefighting aircraft to tackle blazes. Macron said later they also hoped to raise ""at least 30 million"" dollars for a reforestation plan, to be discussed at the UN in September. On Monday evening, he held talks in Biarritz with Brazilian indigenous chief Raoni Metuktire who said he had asked the French leader to ""help us preserve our lands"". Trump was less vocal on this issue than his partners. He also stood out from the rest of the G7 leaders in his budding friendship with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army officer who has given freer rein to industrial farmers and loggers who have made the country an agribusiness power - at a huge cost to the environment. Macron had threatened to block an extensive new trade deal between the European Union and Latin America unless Bolsonaro takes serious steps to combat global warming."""
UK pledges £10 million for fire-ravaged Amazon,,AFP/nh,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/uk-pledges-10-million-for-fire-ravaged-amazon-11842916," BIARRITZ, France: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday (Aug 26) pledged £10 million (US$12.3 million) to help restore the Amazon rainforest which has been ravaged by fires, sparking a wave of global concern. The money would be made available immediately to help restore the habitat, including areas that have been hit by the fires, the British government said in a statement released at the G7 summit in the French resort of Biarritz. The pledge came after French President Emmanuel Macron, who is hosting the summit, said Sunday that world leaders had agreed to help the countries affected by the wildfires as soon as possible. In a week where we have all watched, horrified, as the Amazon rainforest burns before our eyes, we cannot escape the reality of the damage we are inflicting on the natural world,"" Johnson said in a statement. The G7 countries on Monday agreed to release 20 million euros (US$22 million) for the Amazon, most of which will be used to send fire-fighting aircraft, a source in the French presidency said. The club - comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - has also agreed to support a medium-term reforestation plan which will be unveiled at the United Nations in September, a presidential aide said. Although about 60 per cent of the Amazon is in Brazil, the vast forest also takes in parts Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Macron's bid to put the Amazon crisis high on the agenda at the G7 angered Brazil's far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who lashed out over what he sees as outside interference, denouncing the French leader's ""colonialist mentality"". Johnson also said it was essential for the international community to tackle the key environmental issues of climate change and biodiversity loss. ""These are two sides of the same coin - it is impossible to solve one challenge without fixing the other,"" he said. ""We cannot stop climate change without protecting the natural environment and we can't restore global nature without tackling climate change."" He confirmed Britain hopes to host the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, which experts see as a critical moment in testing the commitments of governments to fight against global warming. Johnson said the conference ""will have as a major focus the solutions to climate change that can be found in nature - such as reforestation""."""
Why are the Amazon fires sparking a crisis for Brazil - and the world?,,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/amazon-fires-brazil-environment-climate-change-sparking-crisis-11841490," BRASILIA: A record number of fires ravaging the Amazon has drawn international outrage because of the rainforest's importance to the global environment and prompted Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to dispatch the military to assist in firefighting. Here is what you need to know about the disaster. WHY DOES THE AMAZON MATTER? The Amazon - 60 per cent of which is in Brazil - is the world's largest tropical rainforest. It is considered a biodiversity hot spot, with many unique species of plants and animals. The dense jungle absorbs a huge amount of the world's carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas believed to be the biggest factor in climate change, so scientists say that preserving the Amazon is vital to fighting global warming. HOW BAD ARE THE FIRES? Forest fires in all of Brazil have hit the highest level since at least 2013 and are up 84 per cent this year to Aug 23, compared to the same period a year ago, according to Brazil space research agency INPE. There have been 78,383 fires so far this year, with roughly half of those in August alone. Eight out of nine Amazon states have seen an increase, with the largest state of Amazonas seeing a 146 per cent rise. Residents on the ground in the states of Rondonia and Amazonas states said while there are fires every year they have never seen it this bad, with clouds of smoke blanketing the region. WHAT CAUSED THE FIRES? Fires in the Amazon are often set on purpose to clear land. After loggers extract wood, speculators burn the remaining vegetation to clear it in hopes of selling the land to farmers and ranchers. The Amazon is several months into its dry season during which these fires can more easily spread out of control. Environmentalists say that those setting the fires have been emboldened because they hear Bolsonaro calling for more development of the Amazon and think they will not be punished. Deforestation has risen 67 per cent year-on-year in the first seven months of 2019 and more than tripled in July alone. Environmentalists believe those deforesting are the same people starting the fires. HOW HAS BRAZIL'S GOVERNMENT REACTED? Bolsonaro initially suggested that the fires were normal, then said that non-government organizations themselves were setting the fires to hurt his government. He did not present any evidence and later backed off from that claim. Bolsonaro has said that the country does not have the resources to fight the fires in an area as large as the Amazon, while also warning other countries not to interfere, saying that foreign money was aimed at undermining Brazil's sovereignty. The government has now decided to mobilize the military to fight the fires and several Amazon states have subsequently requested support. It remains unclear exactly how the armed forces will be deployed and how effective they will be. WHAT DO WORLD LEADERS SAY? French President Emmanuel Macron has called the fires an international emergency and ecocide,"" and criticised Brazil's government for not doing more to protect the rainforest. Macron's office said in a statement that it would oppose eventual approval of the free trade deal between the European Union and the South American trade bloc Mercosur, because Bolsonaro lied about environmental concerns at June's G20 summit when it was first agreed to. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have said they are concerned about destruction of the Amazon but said that blocking the trade deal was not the right response. On Sunday, Macron said the leaders of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada were finalising a possible deal at their annual summit on ""technical and financial help"" for the countries affected by the fires, including Brazil. President Donald Trump offered Bolsonaro US assistance in a phone call, but Brazilian officials subsequently said they were not working with the United States to combat the fires. HOW HAS THE PUBLIC REACTED? Brazilians have taken to the streets to protest government inaction on the fires in more than a dozen cities, shutting down major roads in Brasilia and Sao Paulo. Demonstrations have been held outside of Brazilian embassies in Paris and London. On social media, #PrayForAmazonas and similar hashtags have been trending on Twitter. Users posting in support of Bolsonaro have also pushed a hashtag translating as ""TheAmazonWithoutNGOs"" into the trending topics on the platform. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN FOR CLIMATE CHANGE? Scientists fear that continued destruction of the Amazon could push it toward a tipping point, after which the region would enter a self-sustained cycle of forest dieback as it converts from rainforest into savannah. Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre believes 15-17 per cent of the entire Amazon has already been destroyed. At first, researchers thought the tipping point would be 40 per cent destruction. But that has changed with global warming raising temperatures in the Amazon and the increasing number of fires. Nobre now says that the tipping point is more likely at between 20-25 per cent. If the tipping point is triggered, the dieback will take 30 to 50 years, in which time 200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere, Nobre said, making it far harder for the world to keep temperature rises below 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius - the goal to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change."""
Brazilian states ask for military help as Amazon fires rage,,Reuters/aa,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/brazilian-states-ask-for-military-help-as-amazon-fires-rage-11839560," BRASILIA: Six states in Brazil's Amazon region requested military help on Saturday (Aug 24) to combat record fires that are tearing through the rainforest, provoking an international outcry because of the Amazon's central role in combating global warming. The states of Para, Rondonia, Roraima, Tocantins, Acre and Mato Grosso - out of the region's nine - have requested military assistance, according to a spokeswoman for the president's office, a day after President Jair Bolsonaro authorised the military to step in. The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and its protection is seen as vital to the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide it absorbs. Brazil has 44,000 troops stationed in its northern Amazon region that are available to combat forest fires and could send more from elsewhere in the country, said Raul Botelho, the joint chief of staff for the country's military. In a briefing with reporters, Botelho and other officials did not say how many troops would be involved and gave few operational details of how they would be used and where. Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo said forces would be concentrated in certain areas depending on the individual mission. For example, in Porto Velho in Rondonia state, two planes would be made available that have capacity to carry 12,000 liters of water mixed with fire retardant, as well as an infantry brigade, river patrol forces and the local office of the Defense Ministry's Amazon monitoring unit, he said. On Saturday, fewer than 50 personnel will be sent from Brasilia to Porto Velho in Rondonia state to support operations there, including 30 firefighters and 18 communications specialists, Botelho said. Alfredo Sirkis, executive director of think tank Brazil Climate Center and a founder of Brazil's Green Party, said while he supported military involvement, he doubted that anyone would be able to put out the existing fires. Once you have a huge forest fire like that, especially when you don't have all the kind of forest fire-fighting equipment that you have in places like the US or Portugal, it's difficult to extinguish,"" he said. ""They'll only be extinguished by themselves depending on the weather conditions."" The military can help to prevent additional forest fires by enforcing environmental laws and stopping people from setting the fires, Sirkis said. Environmentalists have said that farmers clearing land for pasture were responsible for the uptick in fires. Similarly, Sirkis blamed the fires on speculators seeking to clear the land they hope to later sell for farming, saying they have been emboldened by Bolsonaro's strong rhetoric in favor of development of the Amazon region. Bolsonaro enraged critics on Wednesday when he accused non-governmental organizations of burning down the Amazon rainforest to hurt his government. But on Thursday he admitted for the first time that farmers might be involved in lighting fires in the region."""
How to overcome the fear of flying in bumpy skies,,NYT,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/fear-of-flying-airplane-bumpy-skies-11834848," Lately, at airport gates and security lines, I’m increasingly hearing other frequent flyers share stories of spilled coffee and sudden drops on planes. Threaded through nearly every conversation are questions about whether there has been an upswing in air turbulence, and whether climate change is to blame. Turbulence was never a concern for Ashwin Fernandes, who takes more than 200 flights per year as regional director to the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia for Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings, until a bad flight in 2013 left him spooked. “We were over the Bay of Bengal during monsoon season and the plane started shaking violently and then dropped suddenly,” he recounts. “I didn’t know what to do, except wonder how much worse it would get and when it would end.” Since then, Fernandes has followed a strict set of self-imposed rules, which includes taking daytime flights whenever possible. Red-eye flights, he says, can be more anxiety-provoking because of fatigue. But one question continues to haunt him: Is global warming making the skies less friendly? Maybe, but only at certain altitudes, said Paul D. Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, who is the co-developer of a turbulence-forecasting algorithm that has helped make flight travel more comfortable by avoiding rough air and greener by reducing carbon dioxide emissions via “low turbulence” routes. “Climate change is altering temperature patterns and wind speeds in the upper atmosphere,” he says. “The main consequence for aviation is an increase in clear-air turbulence, or in-flight bumpiness at high altitudes in regions devoid of significant cloudiness or nearby thunderstorms, as the jet stream becomes more unstable.” But severe turbulence, the kind that causes passengers who aren’t wearing their seat belts to defy gravity and lift up from their seats, remains a very rare occurrence. “Only around 0.1per cent of the atmosphere at flight cruising levels contains severe turbulence, so even if that figure were to double or treble because of climate change, severe turbulence will still be very rare,” Williams says, also offering grounds for optimism. “Hopefully, a combination of improved turbulence forecasts and better technology will reduce the number of aircraft encountering turbulence in the future, despite the effects of climate change.” The takeaway is to remain buckled throughout the flight, as is routinely instructed by the cockpit crew before take-off. Airlines want passengers to be comfortable throughout the journey, which is the main reason for avoiding turbulence. Cargo planes, filled with packages instead of people, on the other hand, tend to stay the course even when the air is rough. “No matter how scary it might feel, our pilots are in control and there is no question of structural integrity,” explains Rich Terry, a captain and managing director of fleet support for Delta Air Lines. “Modern aircraft are developed and tested to sustain any level of conceivable turbulence.” Captain Terry says the easiest way to make sense of turbulence is to think about ocean waves cresting and falling. “That same movement happens in the air, so now picture those same movements throughout the atmosphere. When airplanes intersect those waves, you have turbulence.” In other words, it’s a natural occurrence and should be expected — not dreaded. Learn to go with the flow. “Expect, accept, allow” is the self-regulating advice offered by Martin N. Seif, a psychologist with private practices in New York and Connecticut who co-founded the Anxiety and Depression Association of America and is a co-author of What Every Therapist Needs to Know About Anxiety Disorders and Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts. When experiencing turbulence, Seif suggests replacing “what if” thoughts with “what is” thoughts. “Stay present,” he advises. “Anxiety is fueled by catastrophic thoughts and is maintained by attempts to avoid it.” Ashley Nicholls, who frequently flies around the Northeast with her Vermont-based marketing and communications firm, says that when the going gets rough, she distracts herself with math – subtracting from 100 by three’s. “By the time I get to 1, the bumps are done. If they aren’t, I start over.” What about preparing in advance for turbulence by monitoring weather reports and checking the latest phone apps for flight conditions? Both Fernandes and Nicholls believe that this may help to keep the element of surprise at bay, but Seif disagrees. “All that stuff reinforces anxiety and puts the focus on the need to avoid turbulence,” he warns. “The best thing you can do is nothing.” Adam Bluestein, a freelance journalist, grew weary of his worries over weather and decided to rewrite the script in his head. Previously reliant on an array of spiritual talismans — a Ganesh necklace, a tiny Buddha statue, a pouch of crystals, and 36 cents wrapped in a piece of aluminum foil as a Jewish blessing for life — Bluestein found a better way to check in and zone out. He embarked on a cognitive behavioural therapy of his own design, which included educating himself in the laws of space and physics, and then flying to Thailand to re-establish his sense of courage. The outcome was a complete reset of his mental state. He no longer obsesses about what’s out of his control. Letting go, he knows, is the biggest obstacle for anxious flyers. “Now I go up with a calmer state of mind. I observe what’s happening, I don’t react. When I see the wings bend, I know that’s what they are meant to do,” he says, also crediting yoga for helping him “muster of a sense of detachment” even in turbulence. “Recently, I was on a 747 from Amsterdam, in a middle seat, when out of nowhere, the plane dropped by what seemed like 100 feet and my arms flew up,” he says. “When things like that happen now, it causes me to feel a greater calm because I’ve spent so much time working on it. I like when there’s stuff going on. It’s almost reassuring. Ultimately, Bluestein landed on what could be the most grounding response to turbulent skies I’ve encountered: “It’s not about me.” By Nancy Stearns Bercaw © The New York Times"
Commentary: How effectively can Singapore adapt to sea level rise?,,CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-climate-change-effective-polders-pumps-s-100-billion-11833080," SINGAPORE: Singapore isn’t alone in confronting the consequences of rising seas. Several other coastal cities and small islands also face this hazard, and lessons can be drawn from how they plan for and adapt to it. Recent research shows three general approaches can be considered when dealing with the threat of sea level rise. First, accommodate the threat, which includes flood-proofing existing buildings and infrastructure, or designating areas that would be allowed to flood during high tide. Second, retreat from the threat, which includes the removal and reallocation of key infrastructure and assets to areas that the sea cannot inundate. Third, protection from the threat, which includes planting and managing mangrove coasts, or engineered options like sea walls, land reclamation and polders described during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech.   THE PROBLEM: WE STILL CANNOT ANSWER MANY QUESTIONS DEFINITIVELY Our best estimates suggest we can expect sea levels rising by at least a metre in Singapore under current emission scenarios by 2100. It is very likely this magnitude is an underestimate, as recent measurements taken at Greenland indicate melt rates of its ice sheets are significantly increasing every year. Herein lies the challenge: A major consideration in assessing the effectiveness of the options Singapore has in dealing with rising sea levels is that we are unable to definitively answer questions of how much and how fast sea level will rise for Singapore 80 years from today despite access to the best climate models available. The reason isn’t so much the quality or accuracy of models used for gauging future sea levels in Singapore. The uncertainty arises because these levels depend on how much future global greenhouse gas emissions arise from our actions locally and globally. The amount and rate of these emissions strongly affects how quickly large continental ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica – these large kilometres-thick ice sheets are the main sources of global sea level rise – melt and contribute water to the oceans. Hence, the recent governmental initiative to fund S$10 million into future sea level rise research is a welcome one, especially as improved understanding of physical processes affecting sea level rise is critical for adaptation decision-making. DECISIONS WE NEED TO TAKE IN THINKING THROUGH ADAPTATION The physical sciences can help in lowering uncertainties of long-term model forecasts of sea levels, but assessing the total effectiveness of coastal adaptation to rising seas requires an arguably more important social scientific approach. How effective these adaptation measures are strongly depends on the confluence of several factors. First, the role of geography, such as questions of “is there a hinterland that enables coastal retreat?” or “how does the natural or pre-urban coastline historically adapt to rising sea levels?”.   Second, the types of coastal land use exposed, such as the proportion of commercial, residential or industrial areas subject to flooding from rising seas. Third, the prevailing socio-economic context, with important questions such as “are there areas of commercial and cultural heritage are worth protecting more than others?”, or “are there socio-political and economic resources to implement these for the long term?” In Singapore’s case, two relevant examples apply. First, identifying low lying flood-prone areas will not give a full picture of the total vulnerability to rising seas of a region. What’s needed is an assessment of the costs accrued when installing and maintaining coastal protection, and the potential loss of natural ecosystems during its construction. These costs must then be balanced against the benefits of protecting critical infrastructure and property of financial and historical value. This evaluation requires an in-depth socio-economic assessment of current and future land use, as well as the value judgments of existing natural capital or its ecosystem services provided. The net cost-benefits are needed prior to deciding on the coastal adaptation option. WHAT’S NEEDED TO DECIDE ON LONG-TERM PROTECTION MEASURES Second, evaluation of the long-term resilience of each protection measure to increasing sea levels is needed. An engineered dyke or sea wall for polders may be relatively inexpensive and quick to construct, but it serves one protective function and can be prone to catastrophic failure under severe events.   In contrast, a reclaimed coastline with a restored mangrove buffer – like in Chek Jawa or Sungei Buloh – may take more time to develop and requires more careful management. However, this buffer has multiple functions; mangroves can naturally “adjust” to rising sea levels to protect inland areas while reducing coastal erosion, as well as providing both a natural habitat for wildlife, and a recreational park space for visitors. In this case, multi-disciplinary research suggests that nature-based adaptation solutions, which often provide more than one function when protecting coasts from hazards, likely result in more resilient outcomes. Such research, combining science with humanities and social sciences, is clearly needed before deciding on long-term protection measures to sea level rise in Singapore. WINNING THE BATTLE BUT LOSING THE WAR Even when all relevant research is completed, and the “best” measure selected to protect Singapore from rising seas, we must not lose sight that adaptation to climate change alone is insufficient. Mitigation, through reductions of total carbon emissions causing climate change, must go hand-in-hand with adaptation.   The S$100 billion that may be spent on adaptation is likely an underestimate; especially when climate science indicates it is virtually certain sea levels will continue to rise beyond 2100, and more resources would have to be spent on maintaining coastal protection in Singapore in the 22nd century. Further, there are other short-term climate risks that will affect Singapore before sea level rises beyond a metre. These include direct climate impacts such as heatwaves, severe storms, droughts and floods, and their indirect effects on food, water, and disease. These cumulative impacts also require potentially costly adaptation measures. It would thus be sensible to place greater attention on climate change mitigation to greatly lower these risks. While the global response on mitigation is slow but steady, local action can be enhanced considerably. In Singapore, aside from the government-led mitigation measures like the carbon tax, or individual actions involving lowering personal carbon footprints, local companies in the private sector can also act. For instance, financial divestment from fossil-fuel industries, and R&D towards renewable energy technologies in the power generation and transport sectors can be effective in significantly reducing carbon emissions. To extend the military analogy used by PM Lee, ensuring Singapore’s survival from climate change requires fighting multiple battles simultaneously. A strategy of focussing only on the battle against sea level rise may end up being a Pyrrhic victory, especially if other fronts are neglected.

Tusk says 'hard to imagine' EU-Mercosur trade deal while Amazon burns,,AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/tusk-says-hard-to-imagine-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-while-amazon-11840174,"   BIARRITZ, France: EU Council president Donald Tusk said it was hard to imagine the bloc ratifying its trade pact with South America's Mercosur grouping as long as Brazil fails to curb the fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest. The European Union stands by the EU-Mercosur agreement"", Tusk told reporters at a G7 meeting in Biarritz in southern France on Saturday (Aug 24). ""It is hard to imagine a harmonious process of ratification by the European countries as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction of the green lungs of planet earth,"" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron has said the G7 should hold emergency talks on the Amazon fires, taking the lead in piling pressure on Brazil's far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro. He and Irish leader Leo Varadkar have both pledged to block a new trade deal between the EU and Latin American trading bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. But Spain, which has close ties to South America, does not support the moves to block the massive trade, the government in Madrid said Saturday. Spain ""does not share the position of blocking the deal,"" and ""has been at the forefront of the last effort to sign the EU-Mercosur agreement that will open huge opportunities for the two regional blocs,"" Madrid said in an online message to media. 'NOT THE RIGHT RESPONSE' On Friday Germany said that opposing the trade pact was ""not the right response"" to tackling the Amazon fires in Brazil. The fires in the world's largest rainforest have triggered a global uproar and are a major topic of concern at the G7 meeting in Biarritz in southern France. Official figures show 78,383 forest fires have been recorded in Brazil this year, the highest number of any year since 2013. Experts say the clearing of land during the months long dry season to make way for crops or grazing has aggravated the problem. The growing crisis threatens to torpedo the blockbuster trade deal between the European Union and South American countries, including Brazil, that took 20 years to negotiate. Just days before hosting the summit, Macron called for urgent talks on the ""international crisis"" in the world's largest rainforest, saying leaders would hammer out ""concrete measures"" to tackle it. But his remarks drew a sharp retort from Bolsonaro who fumed over his ""colonialist mentality"", prompting Macron to hit back by calling the Brazilian leader a liar over a June pledge to fight global warming. As a result, France opposes a trade deal between the EU and South America's Mercosur nations, effectively killing any chance of it being ratified, a French presidential official said. The proposed deal has also raised hackles among European farmers, worried about the effect on their meat production, and NGOs concerned about the effect on the climate."""
Macron spearheads pressure on Bolsonaro over Amazon fires,24 Aug 2019 05:11AM (Updated: 24 Aug 2019 05:20AM),AFP/ec,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/macron-spearheads-pressure-on-bolsonaro-over-amazon-fires-11838462,"    PARIS: France's Emmanuel Macron led a growing wave of international pressure on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over the fires raging in the Amazon rainforest on Friday (Aug 23), telling him Paris would block efforts to seal a major trade deal. The issue will be high on the agenda when global leaders meet for the G7 summit Saturday in the French resort of Biarritz, where they are also set to tackle global trade wars and the Iran nuclear standoff. Just days before hosting the summit, Macron called for urgent talks on the international crisis"" in the world's largest rainforest, saying leaders would hammer out ""concrete measures"" to tackle it. But his remarks drew a sharp retort from the Brazilian leader who fumed over his ""colonialist mentality"", prompting Macron to hit back by calling Bolsonaro a liar over a June pledge to fight global warming. ""Given the attitude of Brazil over the last weeks, the president can only conclude that President Bolsonaro lied to him at the Osaka (G20) summit,"" a French presidential official said. As a result, France would oppose a trade deal between the EU and South America's Mercosur nations, effectively killing any chance of it being ratified, he said. Moves to prioritise the Amazon wildfires on the G7 agenda won backing from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeting that the fires were ""heartbreaking"" and offering help to put them out. So far this year, there have been 76,720 forest fires in Brazil - the highest number since 2013, official figures show, with more than half in the Amazon rainforest. ""The Amazon rainforest - the lungs which produce 20 percent of our planet's oxygen - is on fire,"" Macron tweeted late Thursday. And on Friday, he expressed hope the G7 would act to ensure speedy reforestation of areas devastated by fire. ""We are going to try and mobilise everyone to raise funding for reforestation as quickly as possible,"" Macron told the French youth news website Konbini, saying he wanted to secure commitments from fellow leaders, including Trump, ahead of the UN's Global Climate Action Summit in New York next month. But in a sign of some of the difficulties, Germany said Macron's proposal to block the Mercosur deal was ""not the right response"". ""Failing to conclude the Mercosur agreement would not contribute to reducing the clearing of the rainforest in Brazil,"" a government spokesman told AFP. Finland, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, also weighed in on the crisis, suggesting it and the EU ""urgently look into the option of banning the import of Brazilian beef"". IRAN STANDOFF The leaders of France, the US, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan already face a litany of issues in Biarritz, which is on a security lockdown for the summit. Macron met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier Friday for last-minute talks trying to soothe tensions between Tehran and Washington. A nuclear deal between Western powers and Iran all but collapsed after Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew US support in May 2018, reimposing economic sanctions on Tehran. ""We're at a critical moment,"" Macron warned on Wednesday, acknowledging that Iran is ""laying out a strategy"" for exiting the 2015 deal. ""President Macron made some suggestions last week to President (Hassan) Rouhani and we believe they are moving in the right direction, although we are not definitely there yet,"" Zarif told AFP in an interview. He said he had a ""good discussion"" with the French leader, who would now hold talks with other European leaders to seek a way forward. 'MIXED SIGNALS'? Macron's diplomacy is delicate, with France seeking to roll back some of the US measures imposed as part of Trump's policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran, which insists its nuclear programme is peaceful. French diplomats have raised the idea of US waivers on sanctions affecting Iranian oil exports to India and China, or a new credit line for Tehran that could help the struggling economy. That prompted Trump to accuse Macron of sending Tehran ""mixed signals"" in his attempt to broker fresh talks between the longtime adversaries. But Trump appears to be the outlier among America's G7 partners on Iran, with a British diplomatic source saying the UK would continue to back the 2015 nuclear deal as the ""best way"" of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The US leader will arrive in the glitzy beachside resort on Saturday already riled by a new French law increasing taxes on US internet giants such as Google and Facebook. He is also threatening tariffs on the European automobile sector. Just before the summit, China fired the latest salvo in its trade war the US, announcing new tariffs on US$75 billion of American imports."""
"Commentary: As ice caps melt, Singapore a hot spot for sea-level rise",23 Aug 2019 06:14AM (Updated: 23 Aug 2019 06:20AM),CNA/sl,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/rising-sea-levels-singapore-impact-equator-water-drawn-11830652," SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 18) warned of a future where East Coast Park and the beach was no more. It was totally gone and in its place was nothing but seawater. Why is the Prime Minister so concerned? Global sea level rose faster in the 20th century than in any of the 27 previous centuries, and observations and projections suggest that it will rise at a higher rate during the 21st century. THE CONSEQUENCES OF RISING SEA LEVELS At this rate, the ocean could be above 1m higher than today by 2100. Here’s what that amount of extra water could mean in terms of probable events unfolding over the next 80 years:   THE CRISIS WE FACE I am very worried about climate change and sea-level rise. I have spent the last 25 years studying the mechanisms that have determined sea-level changes in the past, and how they will shape such changes in the future. Fundamental to this aim is bridging the gap between short-term instrumental records and long-term geological reconstructions and model predictions. We have unequivocally shown that the rate of sea-level rise is greater now than at any time in the past 2,700 years. What’s more, the Earth Observatory of Singapore has found a consistent link between changes in the average global surface temperature and sea level over the same period. Climate isn’t a pendulum and Earth has had periods of ice and heat before, but this is different. Our Earth, the only place we have to live, is being altered by our fossil-fuel-driven industry. We are creating a planet where flooding will become more common and more destructive for the world’s coastal cities. The Earth's average global temperature has risen by 1 degrees Celsius since the 1880s. Decades of data show a long-term uptick in the release and build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which is trapping heat and warming up the land, oceans, and atmosphere and the sea levels are rising. SWALLOWED UP Global sea-level rise is one of the more certain impacts of human-induced global warming. Rising seas are posing a threat in the Maldives, where more than 90 inhabited islands are experiencing annual flooding. In the Pacific, five of the Solomon Islands have disappeared already, swallowed up by the ocean. Closer to home, Cua Dai Beach near the magical Vietnamese town of Hoi An reportedly has several resorts on the brink of collapse and two newly-built resorts never opened because of erosion.   Global warming affects sea level in two ways. About a third of its current rise comes from thermal expansion — when water grows in volume as it warms. The rest comes from the melting of ice on land. So far it’s been mostly mountain glaciers, but the big concern for the future is the giant ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. If all the ice in Greenland melted, it would raise sea levels by 7m. Antarctica has enough water to raise sea-levels 65m. That’s more than a third of the height of the Singapore flyer and 7 times the height of the Merlion statue. And you only need to melt a few per cent of the Antarctic ice sheet to cause devastating impact. Satellite-based measurements of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets show that this melting is accelerating. For example, Greenland's glaciers went from dumping only about 51 billion tonnes of ice into the ocean between 1980 and 1990, to losing 286 billion tonnes between 2010 and 2018. SINGAPORE A HOT SPOT FOR SEA-LEVEL RISE The amount of sea-level rise will vary from place to place. Regional sea-level trends include land subsidence or uplift due to geological processes, the influence of ocean currents and gravity. The relative influence of these regional factors determines whether rates of local sea-level change are higher or lower than the global average, and by how much.   One of these hotspots is Singapore. Because Greenland and Antarctica are so large they exert a significant gravitational pull on water, which means that all the water on the planet is drawn towards the poles. As the ice melts, however, the force of this pull to the poles weakens. This means more water is drawn to the equator instead. So, when ice caps melt, a place such as Singapore, which sits almost on the equator, will actually get much more than its regular share of water - about 30 per cent more. As PM Lee said, Singapore has already taken action to reduce carbon emissions, introducing a wide variety of efforts. The Government also announced in March that it will start a National Sea Level Programme this year to bring together research expertise and better understand how rising sea levels will impact Singapore. TIME TO ACT BOLDLY Individual governments, although signed up to various international agreements, still show reluctance to take actions on the scale and with the urgency necessary. Hopefully PM Lee’s speech will change the dialogue. But for Singapore to decide on the path forward requires robust accurate local projection of sea-level rise. Singapore must invest in the science of sea-level rise before it spends S$100 billion on adaptation measures. The Asian School of Environment and the Earth Observatory of Singapore at NTU will be a leading research unit in this endeavour.   At NTU, we believe if we act boldly and swiftly, if we set aside our political interests in favour of the air that our young people will breathe, and the food they will eat, and the water they will drink, if we think about them and their hopes and dreams, then we will act, and it won’t be too late. We can leave behind a world that is worthy of our children, where there’s reduced conflict and greater cooperation – a world marked not by human suffering, but by human progress.

"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim.

"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""

But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim.

"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend.

No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""

But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
"COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China",17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:39PM),CNA/hs(mi),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116," SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday, and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days. With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime,"" said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. ""For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN,"" said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is ""another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19"". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. ""These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community,"" said MOH. ""We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements,"" it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements.

"COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts",17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM),CNA/hw,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600," SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily,"" said Prof Tam. ""But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again."" Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. ""But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"""
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak,17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM),CNA/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764," SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

"China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei",17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM),Agencies/mn,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692," BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take"". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship,17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:07PM),AFP/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826," WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them onboard, but isolated them from the other passengers. These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols,"" it said. ""During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers."" All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. ""Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized containment area, where they will be treated,"" the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo 14 days quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

"Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening",17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM),Reuters/hs,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616," BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected,"" he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. ""Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China,"" Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

"No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs",17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM),CNA/hz(aj),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830," SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers,"" a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. ""As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes."" The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare ""all face masks and sanitisers"", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a ""surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore"". ""As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment,"" the spokesperson added. ""The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. ""Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued."" The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

New private home sales rebound after year-end holidays; strongest January showing in 7 years,17 Feb 2020 02:52PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 03:00PM),CNA/nc(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-private-home-sales-january-ura-property-12441542," SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes rebounded last month, marking the strongest January showing in seven years. Developers sold 618 homes - excluding executive condominiums - last month, 14.9 per cent higher than the 538 units sold in the preceding month, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday (Feb 17). This was also 41.4 per cent more than the 437 units sold over the same period last year. Last month registered the highest January new private home sales in seven years, according to an OrangeTee & Tie analyst.   Including executive condominiums, 638 units were sold, a 45.7 per cent increase over the 438 units sold in January 2019 and a 15.8 per cent increase on the 551 homes sold last December. January's sales take-up was led by projects in the city fringes or rest of central region (RCR), which accounted for 41.9 per cent (259 units) of total sales excluding executive condominiums, noted OrangeTee & Tie Head of Research and Consultancy Christine Sun. This was followed by the surburban areas or outside central region (OCR), at 36.6 per cent (226 units). The proportion of sales in the luxury segment or core central region (CCR) rose to its highest level since January 2019 at 21.5 per cent (133 units), said Ms Sun. This could be attributed to more high-end projects launched in January, she said, including The Avenir, Leedon Green and Van Holland, which collectively sold 74 units last month. NUMBER OF FOREIGN BUYERS STABLE IN CCR Even within a tumultuous"" economic climate the number of foreign buyers entering the private property market in the CCR segment has remained stable, said PropNex Realty Chief Executive Officer Ismail Gafoor. The segment saw a 32.3 per cent month-on-month increase of new private homes purchased by foreigners, he said, citing data from URA Realis. On a month-on-month basis, the overall volume of CCR transactions increased by 60.2 per cent, he added. ANALYSTS MIXED ON COVID-19 IMPACT So far there seems to have been ""no major impact"" on the property market from the COVID-19 outbreak, said Ms Sun. The disease, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has since spread to more than 25 countries. In Singapore, 75 people have tested positive for the disease as of Sunday. ""There seems to be no major impact on the property market as of now, since it is not one of the sectors directly affected by the coronavirus unlike transport, retail, tourism and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions),"" said Ms Sun. Many developers have also put in place precautionary measures at show flats to protect the health of customers, she added. ""Although it is not immediately clear how the epidemic will pan out, any impact could be temporary and may not cause a long-term adverse impact on the property market here,"" she said, adding that Singapore has proven itself to be resilient amid crises such as the last Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, property analyst Ong Kah Seng said positive buying interest in January was set to change from February, as the novel coronavirus only reached Singapore shores in the last part of January. As the disease spreads in Singapore, private residential sentiments ""will be more cautious"" with selective buying (but ""not pessimistic sentiments"") setting in until the middle of the year, he predicted. Property buyers will be ""realistic, prudent and highly selective"" as the disease dampens global economies, affecting job stability and ""longer term mortagage servicing capabilities by Singaporeans with limited affordability"", he said. ""Only 'contrarian mindset' buyers with utmost confidence and strong affordability capacity will rush in to opportunistically grab a choice unit from developers, likely priced attractively at such challenging economic times and softened property market conditions following (the) COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak,"" said Mr Ong. PropNex's Mr Ismail sounded an optimistic note, saying that historically most crises or downturns do not last long. ""When the storm calms, the tide of the market re-emerges with pent-up demand from buyers and investors,"" he said. ""With the Government potentially announcing measures during the financial Budget to assist affected sectors and the resilient nature of the real estate market, we are likely expect(ing) new home sales volume to reach 9,000 to 10,000 units this year."""""
Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think,17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM),CNA/bk,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854," Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
NTU student who climbed into 15-year-old girl's bedroom to have sex with her gets jail,17 Feb 2020 05:24PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 05:48PM),CNA/ll(rw),https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-student-who-climbed-into-15-year-old-girl-s-bedroom-to-have-12442136," SINGAPORE: A student from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) repeatedly had consensual sex with a girl nine years his junior, climbing up water pipes to enter the teenager's bedroom. For three counts of sexual penetration of a minor, and another six charges taken into consideration, the 26-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (Feb 17). He cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim's identity, as they were in a relationship. The court heard that the accused got to know the victim in 2014, as they were in the same cell group in church. They became friends and began dating in October 2017, when the victim was 15. They first had consensual sex on Oct 26, 2017, when the victim went over to the accused's room after his roommate had left. They had sex a few more times after this, but broke up in December 2017 after the girl's parents found out about the relationship. BROKE UP BUT CONTINUED TO HAVE SEX, MET BEHIND PARENTS' BACKS However, they remained in contact, with the accused giving the teenager a phone to communicate with him behind her parents' back. They also continued to have sex even though they had broken up, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Teo. At about 2am on Jan 21, 2018, the accused entered the victim's bedroom on the second floor through a window. He climbed up the water pipes, and the victim let him into her bedroom, the court heard. He had started meeting her this way in early January 2018, to evade detection by the victim's parents. They had consensual sex, said the prosecutor. The victim then fellated the accused, and he left through the window. Court documents did not reveal how the offences were uncovered, only that the victim's father called the police on Jan 24, 2018, reporting that his daughter had had sex with a student from NTU on several occasions. The prosecution asked for at least 20 months' jail. She said that the accused had exposed the victim, who was a virgin, to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. She added that his offending conduct persisted even after the parties had broken up, and even escalated to the use of more deceptive practices to evade detection, for example climbing into the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night"". Defence lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam asked instead for a probation report, or fewer than eight months' jail if the judge did not agree on probation. THEY WERE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS: DEFENCE Mr Sudheesan said his client and the victim were ""star-crossed lovers"". He said the unfortunate episode started after the victim first kissed the accused, shocking him. They started talking and realised that they had feelings for each other, said Mr Sudheesan. They then discussed the matter and bought condoms together. ""Unfortunately, young people in love can do regrettable things,"" he said, adding that the victim was mature and consenting and ""was not manipulated"". ""This is a case of making love instead of having sex,"" he said, asking the judge to be merciful. The judge said he was ""not minded to call for a probation report"" given the age of the accused, the number of charges and their seriousness, and the young age of the victim. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor above 14 are a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. If the relationship was exploitative, the penalties go up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."""
