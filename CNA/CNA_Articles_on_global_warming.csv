"Global warming causing 'irreversible' mass melting in Antarctica: Scientist","19/02/2020","Reuters/nh","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/global-warming-causing-irreversible-mass-melting-in-antarctica-12449782"," SYDNEY: Global warming was leading to an ""irreversible"" mass melting of the Antarctic ice and purging carbon from the atmosphere was the only solution to slow the process, an Australian climate scientist told Reuters on Wednesday (Feb 19). Recent human activity has intensified global warming, which could result in a mass melting of Antarctica, said Zoe Thomas, a research fellow at the University of New South Wales who was part of an international team of scientists that recently published a paper on Antarctic ice melting. The study showed the world could lose most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which rests on the seabed and is fringed by floating ice, in a warmer world. ""What we're seeing with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, that this starting of the melt, once we reach a certain threshold, will continue despite our efforts to stop it,"" she told Reuters. The team hopes to continue the research to determine how quickly the ice sheets responded to increased temperatures, which would help provide a more concrete time frame for the future. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica of 18.3 degrees Celsius was taken at a research base there on Feb 6. If hotter temperatures were to sustain they could cause an extreme global sea level rise. ""This will gradually displace people as it goes,"" Thomas said. ""We know this is already happening in small island communities and this will just continue to happen gradually as more and more houses are being inundated at high tide, then at normal tide and then even at low tide."" Thomas said that the only thing that would slow down the ice melting was if economies across the world began de-carbonising themselves. ""Once we commit to this de-carbonised future can then we start thinking about potential options for trying to remove carbon from the atmosphere,"" she added. Many advanced economies have pledged to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 though Australia is largely seen as dragging its feet on the issue despite recently suffering one of its worst bushfire seasons ever. According to a forecast published by Britain's Met Office last month, the fires contributed to one of the biggest annual increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere since record-keeping began more than 60 years ago."
"Amazon's Bezos pledges US$10 billion to climate change fight","18/02/2020","Reuters/ad","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/amazon-jeff-bezos-pledge-climate-change-12444798"," NEW YORK: Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will commit US$10 billion to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he said on Monday (Feb 18). Bezos, who is the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires to dedicate substantial funds towards combating the impact of global warming. ""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share."" The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants this summer as part of the initiative. ""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said. Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for US billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft's Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣ Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from US vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC. Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest US$100 million to restore forests and wetlands. Cutting emissions related to Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data center footprint, will be challenging. The company has faced recent protests by environmental activists in France and rising pressure from its own employees to take action on climate change."
"Exclusive: Italian government leaning towards third term for Eni CEO - sources","18/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/exclusive--italian-government-leaning-towards-third-term-for-eni-ceo---sources-12444396"," ROME/MILAN: The Italian government is leaning toward reappointing Claudio Descalzi as CEO of state-controlled oil firm Eni, provided he will work with a new board to speed up efforts to cut carbon emissions, four senior political sources told Reuters. The largest member of the ruling coalition, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has been highly critical of the veteran oilman in the past, not least because he is being tried in Italy for alleged corruption over a 2011 oil deal in Nigeria. Descalzi denies any wrongdoing. However, Rome is keen for an experienced leader with a track record of dealing with geopolitically sensitive areas such as Africa and the Middle East to oversee interests there, and to help Eni shift toward cleaner sources of energy without inflicting too much damage on profitability. ""No final decision has been made yet, but Descalzi has a good chance to be reappointed,"" a government member of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Eni, a rich source of dividends for stretched state coffers, has traditionally been seen as a key piece of Italy's energy policy and also important for foreign policy because of its extensive overseas presence. Descalzi's second term leading the company comes to an end in May and the government is expected to flag as soon as March whether or not he will be kept on. The 64-year old executive is due to present Eni's latest business plan on Feb. 28. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri, a PD minister, said on Friday that ""very valuable people"" were running state-owned companies, which also include utility giant Enel and defense group Leonardo , but did not elaborate. The 5-Star Movement is not opposing Descalzi's reappointment as long as he is prepared to work with a new board to accelerate moves to cut carbon emissions, a prominent member of the movement said. ""He is winning round key figures in the party,"" the official said, also asking not to be named. The nomination process at Italy's state-controlled companies is traditionally the subject of intense political horse trading because of their size and importance. Talks usually go down to the wire and can change unexpectedly on political vagaries. The Treasury, which owns 4.34per cent of Eni and controls another 25.76per cent via state lender CDP, has the right to appoint six members of Eni's nine-strong board. It is expected to present a list of candidates that will include the name of the new CEO. The Treasury declined to comment for this story, as did Eni. DON'T ROCK THE BOAT Descalzi was first appointed to the top job at Eni in 2014 by the government of Matteo Renzi, whose Italy Alive party is now a junior member of the ruling coalition. Helped by major discoveries in Egypt and Mozambique, Descalzi transformed the company into one of the industry's most successful oil and gas explorers. He has shunned costly bets on North American shale gas and more recently won accolades from investors by signing a flurry of deals in the Gulf. However, his leadership has not been without controversy. In one of the oil industry's biggest ever scandals, Italian prosecutors allege Eni and Royal Dutch Shell bought a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 knowing most of the US$1.3 billion purchase price would go to agents and middlemen in bribes. The trial, which includes Descalzi because he led Eni's exploration and production business at the time of the transaction, is drawing to a close, but is not expected to conclude until after the nomination process for a new CEO. Eni and Shell, like Descalzi, have denied wrongdoing. Despite the allegations, two of the sources said Rome was drawn to keeping Descalzi as a steady pair of hands at a time of increasing turmoil in Libya, where Eni is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. ""The (Italian) government at the moment is weak and the message coming out of Rome is to rock the boat as little as possible,"" one of them said. Descalzi's experience could also help Eni meet growing pressure from politicians and investors for oil companies to do more to address global warming. The CEO, a physicist by training, set up Eni's green energy unit in 2015 and introduced a target for net-zero carbon emissions from exploration and production operations by 2030. However, rivals such as Repsol , Shell and, more recently, BP , have gone further, and Descalzi is under pressure to set bolder targets. ""He's got the ball rolling but now he's got to raise the bar,"" one of the sources said. (Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte and Giselda Vagnoni in Rome, Stephen Jewkes in Milan, Editing by Mark Potter)"
"Climate change could make premiums unaffordable: QBE Insurance","17/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-could-make-premiums-unaffordable--qbe-insurance-12441584"," SYDNEY: Australia's QBE Insurance Group said on Monday climate change could make some premiums unaffordable, especially for customers exposed to extreme weather events, and was a ""material risk"" for its operations across the globe. During 2019, QBE's net Australia-Pacific cost of catastrophe claims jumped to US$193 million from US$106 million the year before, led by unprecedented floods in Australia's north east coast and horrendous bushfires across the country's south east. The insurer said it has started to adjust its catastrophe models to factor in the expected impacts of climate change until 2100, and would assess the impact on its weather-related exposures from emissions and temperatures. In the short-term, QBE would manage higher claims by considering event frequency and severity in its capital planning and will deploy a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program, it said. Over the long-term, it expected the physical impacts of climate change ""will result in our customers seeking increased insurance for the protection of their assets and the services they provide."" ""This may cause insurance premiums to become unaffordable, especially for customers in areas more exposed to weather-related events, potentially resulting in a loss of revenue."" Insurers and banks are also facing stricter regulatory scrutiny over their response to global warming, with shareholders expecting better disclosures and transparency on climate-related risks. In its annual climate disclosure, QBE said it plans to phase out all direct insurance services for thermal coal customers by 2030, in an effort to cut emissions responsible for rising global temperatures. It is also committed to shunning direct insurance services for new thermal coal mines, power stations or thermal coal transport infrastructure. Globally, the economic costs from natural disasters have exceeded the 30‑year average for seven of the last 10 years, while the number of extreme weather events globally has tripled since the 1980s, QBE CEO Pat Regan said in the company's annual report.

"UN's Guterres calls for 'transformational change' on climate","17/02/2020","AFP/de","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/un-s-guterres-calls-for--transformational-change--on-climate-12440330"," ISLAMABAD: Governments must deliver decisive actions and ""transformational change"" to combat global warming, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday (Feb 16), blasting a recent climate summit in Madrid. The so-called COP25 climate talks in the Spanish capital in December were supposed to build on breakthrough promises made at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. Instead, governments equivocated and observers decried their response as inadequate and unambitious. ""Our planet is burning but too many decision makers continue to fiddle,"" Guterres said in a speech he delivered in Islamabad. ""The only answer is decisive climate action ... Gradual approaches are no longer enough."" A United Nations panel concluded late in 2018 that avoiding global climate chaos will require a major transformation of society and the world economy. The landmark report said global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030, and reach ""net zero"" by 2050, to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the safe cap set as a goal in the Paris accord. Guterres said that at the next climate conference, the COP26 in Glasgow later this year, ""governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition."" Guterres said rich countries should lead the way, including by ending ""perverse"" fossil fuel subsidies. Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to intensify their efforts. The summit was at times close to collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests. Guterres credited Pakistan for banning plastic bags in the capital Islamabad and for a large tree-planting programme. Guterres is in Pakistan for a three-day visit that will include his attendance at a conference on Pakistan's hosting of Afghan refugees for 40 years. Pakistan is one of the largest refugee-hosting nations in the world, home to an estimated 2.4 million registered and undocumented people who have fled Afghanistan, some as far back as the Soviet invasion of 1979. Many live in camps, while others have built lives for themselves in Pakistan's cities, paying rent and contributing to the economy. Guterres said the ""preferred, durable solution for the refugees has always been one-time repatriation with safety and dignity to the country of origin""."
"Antarctica registers record temperature of over 20 degrees Celsius","14/02/2020","AFP","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctica-registers-record-temperature-of-over-20-degrees-12434124"," SAO PAULO: Scientists in Antarctica have recorded a new record temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius, breaking the barrier of 20 degrees for the first time on the continent, a researcher said on Thursday (Feb 13). ""We'd never seen a temperature this high in Antarctica,"" Brazilian scientist Carlos Schaefer told AFP. He cautioned that the reading, taken at a monitoring station on an island off the continent's northern tip on Feb 9, ""has no meaning in terms of a climate-change trend"", because it is a one-off temperature and not part of a long-term data set. But news that the icy continent is now recording temperatures in the relatively balmy twenties is likely to further fuel fears about the warming of the planet. The reading was taken at Seymour Island, part of a chain off the peninsula that curves out from the northern tip of Antarctica. The island is home to Argentina's Marambio research base. Schaefer, a soil scientist, said the reading was taken as part of a 20-year-old research project on the impact of climate change on the region's permafrost. The previous high was in the 19s, he said. ""We can't use this to anticipate climatic changes in the future. It's a data point,"" he said. ""It's simply a signal that something different is happening in that area."" Still, he added, a temperature that high had never been registered in Antarctica. Accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially ice sheets in Antarctica is helping drive sea level rises, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations. The news came a week after Argentina's National Meteorological Service recorded the hottest day on record for Argentine Antarctica: 18.3 degrees Celsius at midday at the Esperanza base, located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on Mar 24, 2015, it said. It has been recording Antarctic temperatures since 1961. The past decade has been the hottest on record, the United Nations said last month, with 2019 the second-hottest year ever, after 2016. And 2020 looks set to continue the trend: Last month was the hottest January on record."
"Japan needs to apologise more, China needs to say thank you more, says famed prof","13/02/2020","CNA/dp","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/japan-apologise-china-say-thank-you-us-harvard-prof-ezra-vogel-12429600"," SINGAPORE: He has spent six decades studying China and Japan, a time span that is only 15 years shy of the end of World War II. In that time, the old wounds of Japanese war atrocities in China have yet to heal. And the question of whether Japan needs to apologise in the way Germany has is never far away. Ezra Vogel, the famed 89-year scholar and Harvard University emeritus professor of social sciences, does not think it would change China’s basic foreign policy considerations. But he agrees that Japan needs “to apologise more”. He also thinks China needs “to say thank you more” — because the Japanese became major contributors of foreign aid to the Chinese after they signed their Treaty of Peace and Friendship.   “The Japanese feel that ... (they) were very generous, after 1978, in helping China. They were giving more aid, more technological assistance, to China than any other country,” he says. “That was given instead of reparations, and the Chinese leaders acknowledged privately at the time that that’s what the meaning was. But the Chinese (leaders) haven’t done so much publicly, and many Chinese are completely unaware of that.” Fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, he has produced bestsellers like Japan As Number One and an authoritative, 900-page tome on Deng Xiaoping. He has even been criticised for being an unabashed admirer of Tokyo and Beijing. For the record, he says he is not an East Asian apologist. Few in the West, however, know those countries better.   And ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan in April — his first and one that experts say is a remarkable warming of bilateral relations — Prof Vogel gives his take on their relationship and also on Sino-American ties. That includes the question of whether Beijing is trying to tug Japan out of Washington’s grasp by cosying up to Tokyo. BETTER TIES LIKELY, BUT NOT BFFs Just a few years ago, China and Japan had a bitter territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. And although Prof Vogel reckons that relations are likely to improve now, he doubts that the Japanese will “feel comfortable being real friends”. “They saw the pictures of Japanese businesses being trashed on television (and of) Chinese planes and ships ... near the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands (in 2013),” he cites. “They look at the movies of WWII, which the Japanese have seen on television from China ... And (they’re) worried that if Chinese domestic problems should get very serious ... it would be quite popular in China to become anti-Japanese again.”   If they would “put in their textbooks more about the horrors they’ve done”, and be more apologetic, he thinks it would make them less vulnerable to Chinese criticism. “When things are tense, China can always pull out the lack of apology to create problems with Japan,” he notes. Many younger Japanese, however, are “tired” of hearing the same old thing. “They say, ‘Why should I apologise for things that happened before I was born?’ And they say, ‘We’ve apologised already. Why’s China pushing us?’” says the professor. “The Japanese know they did bad things in WWII. They realise a lot of countries have done bad things. And they want to improve relations. But they don’t feel that they’re uniquely bad people.”   Mr Xi’s current overtures to Japan come not only a few years after bilateral tensions had been heightened, but also a decade after China overtook Japan as the world’s second-largest economy. That has since meant a “readjustment” of their relationship. “(The Chinese) feel that they’re now in a strong position, that the power they worry about isn’t Japan but the US,” says Prof Vogel. And because China is Japan’s largest trading partner, and Japan is China’s second-largest trading partner after the US, “there’s a very deep interlinkage”. So he thinks an improvement in ties is the likely outcome in April. “The Japanese have a slogan: That the economics between China and Japan are hot, and the politics are cold. I think the politics can become lukewarm,” he adds. “They can calm things down and have better working relationships.”   But they do not “feel confident that they can rely on China to remain friends over a long period” — even if, as some commentators say, Mr Xi is attempting to slowly move Japan away from the US. “If I were Japanese and thinking where my dangers are coming from in the future, I don’t think I’d worry about what the US would do to me. But I’d worry about what the Chinese might do,” says Prof Vogel. “There’s no way the Japanese military budget can compare with China’s in future. In that situation, I think the Japanese still feel that if there were some kind of emergency or difficult issue, they’d want to rely on the US.” And that means keeping a deep defence relationship with the US.   NO CONSENSUS ON CHINA China’s economy is also poised to surpass that of the US — in the next 10 years, say some forecasters. But the problem with their relationship “is much deeper and is going to be harder to resolve”, says Prof Vogel. “(The US) feels that it’s the strongest power in the world. And (there are) those who feel it’s their responsibility to defend our country against any other country, especially one that’s communist, authoritarian and doesn’t respect human rights,” he adds. “The American people feel that this is a very different kind of country ... particularly since China has been advancing and building little islands in the South China Sea.” One of the big questions now is whether there will be a single, integrated global economy, or a split between the Chinese and US economies. The signs are ominous. “Many of the American companies that felt they were working with China quite well feel that they’re no longer as welcome, and that the Chinese government helps (Chinese) firms and makes things very difficult,” says Prof Vogel. “Google can’t operate in China the way it operates in the US. So there’s a feeling in America that (the Chinese) haven’t played by the same kind of rules.”   According to him, however, many of those who study China feel that the Chinese “have done far more to adapt”, and that the mood in Washington is “overblown”. There are far more people in China we can work with, and we feel that we have to work with them in a much more positive way — that if we treat them like an enemy, they can become an enemy. This view of his had prompted him, together with a group of diplomats and other academics, to write an open letter to US President Donald Trump last year, titled China Is Not The Enemy. This came about a year after an “influential article” in the Foreign Affairs magazine said engagement has not worked, which seemed to embody a Washington consensus that China “was something to worry about” and unite against.   Although there are not only Republicans, but also “a lot of Democrats who believe that”, Prof Vogel argues that a fair portion of Americans do not share that sentiment. Even the friends he grew up with in a small town in the Midwest “have different ideas about China”. “The anti-Chinese mood is much stronger in Washington than it is in America as a whole,” he says. “There’s a kind of frustration on the one hand and ... political opportunism, on the other hand, of congressmen and some people in Washington who hope to get jobs in future administrations (and) find it in their interests to be very tough on China.” Those who are like him, however, believe that China, the US and the world “would be better served by finding ways in which we can work with each other”. “There are many of us who hope that we can put America on a better path, but we don’t know (if we can),” he says.

"Britain's COP26 climate talks 'can't fail': UK's energy minister","12/02/2020","AFP/nr","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/britain-s-cop26-climate-talks-can-t-fail-uk-s-energy-minister-12428378"," PARIS: The world can't afford for crunch climate talks this year to fail, Britain's energy minister said Wednesday (Feb 12), despite the government not having named a leader for the summit starting in November. Speaking at an International Energy Agency (IEA) event in Paris, Kwasi Kwarteng said that the COP26 climate negotiations would be the ""top international priority"" for his government despite it occurring just weeks before the Brexit negotiation period is due to expire. ""We can't guarantee success,"" Kwarteng told country and industry representatives at the IEA. ""What I can commit to is that this is absolutely our number one priority as a government. ""I'm confident it will be a success because we really can't afford it to be a failure, not just on a global level. It's also on a national level given where we are with Brexit and other issues,"" Kwarteng added. The COP26 talks in November are the final negotiating session before the landmark 2015 Paris climate deal goes into effect. The accord saw nations pledge to limit global temperature rises to ""well-below"" two degrees Celsius and to work towards a safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius. To do so greenhouse gas emissions need to fall sharply - 7.6 per cent annually by 2030, according to the latest United Nations estimate. The IEA said Tuesday that emissions from energy, which account for the majority of manmade carbon pollution, had flatlined in 2019 after two successive annual increases. ""2019 is potentially an inflexion point but we have to work very hard to ensure it represents a peak number and not simply a staging post to even more emissions,"" said Kwarteng. He was speaking several days after Britain's original choice for COP26 president, former energy minister Claire O'Neill, was removed from the role. She responded with scathing criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet's handling of preparations. In a letter to Johnson leaked to the Financial Times, she warned: ""We are miles off track. ""You promised to 'lead from the front' and asked me what was needed 'money, people, just tell us!'. Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met."" O'Neill said that a COP26 planning sub-committee had not met once in the months since she was appointed, and told the BBC she believed Johnson ""really doesn't understand"" climate change. With just 1C of warming above pre-industrial levels so far, the world is already experiencing record heatwaves, wildfires and storm surges made worse by rising seas. The COP26 in Glasgow is the last chance for countries to accelerate their plans for voluntary emissions cuts. Current pledges have Earth on course to warm more than 3 degrees Celcius by 2100."
"BP boss Looney 'reinvents' oil giant with zero carbon goal","12/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/bp-boss-looney--reinvents--oil-giant-with-zero-carbon-goal-12428396"," LONDON: BP plans deep cuts to its carbon emissions by 2050, setting one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets, as part of the biggest overhaul in the company's 111-year history by new chief executive Bernard Looney. The targets set out by Looney on Wednesday put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Equinor and all of the U.S. oil majors. ""We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations of us,"" he said in his first major speech as CEO. ""We need to reinvent BP,"" he said earlier in a statement. BP did not specify how it intends to reach its 2050 targets to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, which include diesel or petrol. Smaller Spanish rival Repsol has set similar net zero carbon targets for the oil products it sells, also known as Scope 3, at a cost of more than US$5 billion. This does not include emissions from products it markets but which were produced by other groups, Repsol said. The huge scale of BP's operations puts its aims at the vanguard in oil and gas. BP has tried reinventing itself before. A pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s ended with huge losses. Since then, the world's top oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. ""The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner,"" Looney added. Shares in BP were up 1.3per cent at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January. BP's absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets but does not produce itself. This is a uniquely structured target for oil majors, which, apart from Repsol, have not set any absolute reduction targets for any of its Scope 3 emissions. BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut its emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. A spokesman said near-term plans would be published by a September investor day. One way of reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets is to offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology which is not yet used at a commercial scale. U.S. groups such as Exxon , Chevron and ConocoPhillips are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. (Graphic: Oil majors&apos; carbon emissions png - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QEMZ7NW/eikon.png) Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. Greenpeace said BP's plan left many questions unanswered. ""How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?,"" Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, said. 'NEW EXPECTATIONS' BP will set ""new expectations"" for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit them if they are not aligned. Last year, BP invested around US$500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of US$15.2 billion in 2019. In one of its biggest-ever changes, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit. ""We need to become more integrated and more focused,"" Looney said. A new production and operations unit, which include oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal, while innovation and engineering will be led by David Eyton.

"Shareholder activists test JPMorgan's Dimon on climate proposals","12/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/shareholder-activists-test-jpmorgan-s-dimon-on-climate-proposals-12428330"," BOSTON/NEW YORK: Shareholder activists focused on climate issues vowed to press proxy battles with JPMorgan Chase & Co after getting a cold reception from the top Wall Street bank, even though Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has vowed to protect the environment. Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending. JPMorgan's position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday. ""They're not walking their talk,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview. She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency's website, JPMorgan argued that her group's request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to ""micromanage"" the company. ""I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there’s no way you can talk to us about anything,"" Fugere said. JPMorgan representatives did not immediately comment. Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also targeted other banks and energy companies with climate proposals this year and hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc to put more focus on environmental issues. Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks. Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a ""statement of corporate purpose,"" arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment.

"Pope dismisses proposal to ordain married men as priests in Amazon","12/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-dismisses-proposal-to-ordain-married-men-as-priests-in-amazon-12427450"," VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, in one of the most significant decisions of his papacy, on Wednesday (Feb 12) dismissed a proposal to allow some married men to be ordained in the Amazon region to ease an acute scarcity of priests. The recommendation, put forward by Latin American bishops last year, had alarmed conservatives in the deeply polarised 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, who feared it could lead to a change in the centuries-old commitment to celibacy among priests. Francis delivered his response in an Apostolic Exhortation, three months after the proposal passed by 128 votes to 41 at a contentious Vatican assembly, or synod, of Roman Catholic bishops. Apostolic Exhortations are used to instruct and encourage the Catholic faithful but do not define Church doctrine. Wednesday's 32-page document did not even mention the proposal, which was for older married deacons who are proven leaders of remote Catholic communities and have stable families to be ordained as priests. Conservatives balked, fearing that even a circumscribed change would be a slippery slope leading to a married priesthood throughout the Church. They branded a pre-synod working document as heretical. In what some viewed as a strategically timed appeal to Francis not to approve the Amazon proposal, a book published last month by Church conservatives defended the tradition of priestly celibacy. ""From the Depths of Our Hearts"" was co-authored by Cardinal Robert Sarah and Former Pope Benedict, though Francis' predecessor subsequently disassociated himself from the project. Vatican officials said the pope completed the document on Dec. 27, before the book controversy, and handed it in for translations. They said no changes were made after that. In the Exhortation, the 82-year-old Argentine pope wrote, new ways must be found to encourage more priests to work in the remote region, and allow expanded roles for lay people and permanent deacons, of whom the Amazon needed ""many more"". Deacons, like priests, are ordained ministers. They can preach, teach, baptise and run parishes, but they cannot say Mass. Married men can become deacons. Because only priests can say Mass, people in at least 85% of Amazon villages cannot attend the liturgy every week and some cannot do so for years. ""This urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America ... to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region,"" he wrote. He used the first three chapters of the document to defend the rights and legacies of indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon, which had to be protected because of its vital role in mitigating global warming. Conservatives feared that if Francis had taken up the proposal, other areas with a shortage of priests would follow, even in developed countries such as Germany, where the issue is being discussed."
"Commentary: Japan’s new resource strategy to tackle climate change is risky","12/02/2020","CNA/ml","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/japan-new-strategy-to-tackle-climate-change-12422966"," CANBERRA: The second Japan–Australia Economic Ministerial Dialogue was held in January in Melbourne. Before the meeting, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kajiyama described Australia as a key strategic partner for Japan. The Minister noted this year’s discussions focus on collaboration in hydrogen and carbon-recycling, in addition to trade and other issues. The introduction of carbon-recycling to Australia–Japan bilateral dialogue reflects a big change in Japan’s international resources strategy. Japan has spent huge sums of money on energy security policies to diversify the energy sources used to fuel its economy, and the locations from which it imports fuel. The Japanese nuclear power program was a central plank of this mission prior to the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster of 2011. The Japanese government is now tackling climate change in its resource strategy by introducing a suite of policies it labels carbon-recycling. In doing so, Japan is linking its technology-centred approach to climate change mitigation to long-standing energy security policies that enjoy legitimacy across all branches of government. AUSTRALIA AS A KEY PARTNER Japan’s carbon-recycling agenda includes support for technologies designed to capture carbon dioxide and use it to generate a range of commodities including chemicals, fuels and concrete products. Australia has long been a partner in Japan’s resource strategy, gaining billions of dollars in investment in natural gas, coal, and increasingly rare earth elements. It is emerging as a key partner in the new carbon-recycling initiative. On Sep 25, 2019, the then-Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matt Canavan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation to explore joint research and development into technologies that see “carbon dioxide as a resource, rather than viewing it merely as a waste product”.   The Japan–Australia Energy and Resources Dialogue was also created on June 16 as a platform to facilitate planning and implementation. Japan and Australia are natural partners in tackling climate change. Australia has the potential to be a zero-carbon export superpower, and Japan is a key technology provider to the world. Hydrogen produced by renewable energy is a potential long-term technology for decarbonising industrial sectors including steel. Japan has deployed electric vehicles more rapidly than Australia and uses energy efficiently. The machinery of government in Japan is also better geared towards developing green industry policies. Australia, on the other hand, has more experience in managing the uptake of renewables in competitive electricity markets. CARBON-RECYCLING AS A RISKY BET But Japan’s carbon-recycling strategy carries real risks. The rate of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needed to minimise the risk of catastrophic climate change is steep. Global commitments under the Paris Agreement lead to expected temperature increases of 3.2 degrees Celsius within the lifetime of a child born today. To meet a 1.5 degree Celsius global warming target, countries need to decrease carbon dioxide emissions globally by 7.6 per cent every year between now and 2030. If delayed even by five years, the rate increases to 15.4 per cent. The world is going to burn large quantities of fossil fuels for many decades to come, and it makes sense to invest in technologies that might buy more time. But collaboration on long-term solutions is not a substitute for deploying existing technologies — such as in wind, solar photovoltaics, and energy efficiency — to achieve zero-net emissions as quickly as possible. It is also not clear what the long-term benefits of carbon-recycling will be. If carbon dioxide is used to make fuels, it will re-enter the atmosphere if the fuels are burned without additional capture and storage efforts. The Japanese government’s own explanations of its new resources strategy show that one goal is to enable investment in fossil fuel production currently made marginal by environmental costs, increasing the global supply of fossil fuels.   Japan also supports building a hydrogen supply chain using fossil fuels. But even with carbon capture and storage technologies — which Japan’s ‘carbon recycling’ strategy emphasises — hydrogen can be no better than burning fossil fuels. Worryingly, Japan’s new resources strategy also includes support for the construction of coal plants. The Japanese government remains a large financer of thermal coal plants in developing countries. Japan has been criticised for supporting coal projects that are unlikely to operate for their projected lifetimes. Many Japanese companies are postponing or cancelling coal projects at home because of financial risks and exiting the coal industry abroad. Doubling down on the financing of coal technology increases money flowing to projects that are increasingly subject to stranded asset risk. Ultimately what matters is the rapid deployment of zero-carbon technologies at scale. Australia and Japan are natural partners in this effort. But it is crucial to assess whether technologies can make a real contribution to decarbonisation. And long-term technology collaboration cannot distract governments in Japan and Australia from collaborating to deploy low-carbon technologies already available as quickly as possible.

"In fire-hit rural Australia, climate debate burns deep","11/02/2020","Reuters/jt","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/in-fire-hit-rural-australia--climate-debate-burns-deep-12422084"," BUCHAN, Australia: Returning from a morning feeding his sheep, Jeff McCole, a 70-year-old farmer, paused to take in the bittersweet scene – a few droplets of rain falling onto the remains of his fire-ravaged home. ""Nothing like the sound of rain on a tin roof,"" he said, as he scanned the residue of a lifetime of memories scattered before him. By the old front door was a charred metal toy truck his grandchildren once raced down the verandah. Under the remains of the tin roof, a collection of books, his wife's ""pride and joy"", had been reduced to layers of feathery ash. And out back, the skeleton of a Valencia orange tree, planted by his mother 65 years ago, was now laden with baubles of charcoaled fruit.   Seasonal bushfires have struck Australia in a way like never before, making for months of monster blazes and toxic haze, and fuelling a polarising debate over climate change. But in Buchan, a conservative-voting farming town in Victoria state that is home to the McCole farm, most locals said they believed the catastrophic fires had nothing to do with global warming. Climate change was ""a load of crap"", said McCole, an idea pushed by city folk with ""no experience in the bush"" and no understanding of Australia's punishing, cyclical climate. ""We've had severe droughts and everything like that, 70 years ago,"" said McCole, a Vietnam war veteran with sky-blue eyes. ""It just keeps going around in circles. If you wait, it's going to change."" RISING RISKS For decades scientists have warned that climate change would increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia. This year, there was the perfect storm – record-breaking drought and heat coalescing on tinderbox land. Before rains slowed their spread in recent days, the fires had burned through almost 12 million hectares, destroyed more than 2,800 homes, and claimed the lives of 33 people. An estimated one billion native animals are also believed to have died. Australia has one of the world's highest carbon footprints per capita and is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas, making successive governments reluctant to adopt climate change policies they say could undermine the economy. But with these unprecedented bushfires, the government has come under increased pressure from environmental groups, scientists and broader swathes of the Australian public to address the climate change issue. ""People are more fearful of the future because they glimpsed the future this summer,"" said Lesley Hughes, a professor and climate scientist at Macquarie University. ""I think it has been really wounding of the Australian psyche.""   Polling by the Australia Institute, a Canberra think tank, in January found that 79 per cent of Australians said they were concerned about climate change, up five percentage points from last July, with 47per cent ""very concerned"", a jump of 10 points. But there remains widespread scepticism that the severity of the fires is due to climate change, with many conservative politicians and media suggesting that factors such as arson, the length of cyclical droughts or poor management of flammable vegetation are more responsible. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had previously declined to discuss the link between climate change and the fires, recently acknowledged the connection, but said his priority was managing the economic impact. Morrison last week cited ""hazard reduction"" – which includes the practice of controlled burns to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the bush, as a key to mitigating fires in the future, saying it was just as important as reducing emissions. Climate scientists say that the bigger problem for Australia are longer droughts and increasingly hot summers.   The issue of controlled burns is a deeply emotional one in Buchan, where at least 20 homes were lost in the fires that struck in December. ""Climate change or not,"" said Donald Graham, a farmer who survived the fires huddled in his concrete bunker with a stack of cheese and vegemite sandwiches. ""These fires were a disaster waiting to happen."" A DEATH TRAP The road from Melbourne to Buchan winds past a series of small country towns, pie shops and historic churches and, after a weekend of rain, verdant green fields with dairy cows. But closer to Buchan, population 385, the road is eerily burnt out, lined by rows of black tree trunks sticking out of ashy ground. When the bushfires hit the town on Dec. 30, they roared in on three fronts with a ferocity that no locals had ever seen. For more than a month, fires had raged ominously in nearby bushland, finally bellowing in with ""one heck of a red glow"", McCole said.   From the verandah of his home, nestled on a 400-hectare property of rolling hills, gum trees and Merino sheep, he watched a giant orange plume crest over the hill and rain down fiery embers. ""We only had ten minutes to get out and I think that was the best call I ever made,"" he said with a wry laugh. ""It was a death trap."" The town of Buchan is a single main street with a general store and a pub - the kind of place where locals have time to discuss the pressing issues of the day with a stranger. ""The issue of climate change and the fire is a dead duck as far as I'm concerned,"" said Graham, an animated 68-year-old cattleman with a shock of gray hair. ""What is the most significant thing, is the changing structure of the forest."" Minutes before he watched his house go up in flames from the peephole of his bunker, Graham raced inside to grab a picture from the wall, a colonial lithograph featuring the magnificent valley below overlooking the confluence of the Snowy and Buchan rivers.   The picture is significant because it shows how much the land has changed, he said. ""We've got an accumulation of vegetation. Our area was burned 50 to 70 years ago and it has not burned since, and at some point it will burn,"" he said. ""It just needs a few things to come together, a few dry years and some lightning and neither of those are peculiar to the Australian landscape."" His neighbour John Coates, a 76-year-old cattle farmer, said that decades of vegetation growth had turned the land into a ""timebomb"". Walking through their property overlooking the Snowy River National Park, Coates and his wife Janice shook their heads at the destruction – bald, blackened hills and the devastated gorge below, once filled with ferns, lyrebirds and platypus in the creek. Many locals in Buchan recall the days they would carry a box of matches in their pockets so they could carry out their own hazard-reduction burns. But regulations subsequently put in place aimed at protecting state forests and bushland mean they are now dependent on government agencies for carrying out controlled burns. For years, local farmers had urged the government to carry out burns to reduce the ""fuel load"", or the accumulation of trees, underbrush and dry grass that can turn a small bushfire into an inferno, Coates said. But it never happened.   Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer for Forest Fire Management Victoria, said in a statement to Reuters that his agency had planned to burn 246,396 hectares of the state's public land last year, but was ""unable to do so because it would have been unsafe"". Scientists also say the drought and increasingly hot weather means there are fewer days that vegetation can be safely burned. Commenting on the issue in New South Wales, Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said it was not a case of failing to implement techniques that had worked in the past, but that such techniques were ""insufficient to address the scenario now"". ""You can't blame the dry conditions and say it has no relevance to climate change,"" he said. ""It's a combination of many different climatic changes that can be linked back to the overall trend."" SEASONS 'OUT OF SYNC' In Buchan, not everyone in town was averse to talk of climate change – a few spoke of the seasons being ""out of sync"", the lack of rain or the demise of fragrant yellow box flowers in the valley. But the fires have mainly reinforced pre-existing views and gripes, reflecting the polarising rhetoric of the national climate change debate. Last November, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack – who heads the party that won in the electorate that includes Buchan – described climate change concerns as those held by ""inner-city raving lunatics"".   That messaging appeared to resonate in Buchan, far from the skyscrapers and the lights of Melbourne or Sydney, with a strong sense that people here were living far greener lives. ""They blame our cows,"" said McCole, referring to recent attention on the earth-warming methane produced by belching or flatulent cattle. But, he said, ""they are all jumping on electric trains and cars and god knows what in the city and there are millions of them, flying around the world in jumbo jets."" ""It takes a good cow to put out that many emissions,"" he said. ""I can tell ya."""
"Bong Joon-ho: South Korea's boundary-pushing satirist","10/02/2020","AFP/ic(hs)","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/about-bong-joon-ho-profile-south-korea-director-12416638"," South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho has been on quite a wild ride this awards season. That trip reached its climax Sunday evening (Feb 9) – Monday (Feb 10) Singapore time – when he secured his country's first-ever Oscars for Parasite. The film, a vicious satire about the widening gap between rich and poor, took home Academy Awards for best original screenplay and best international feature after winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe and two Baftas. ""We never write to represent our countries,"" said the 50-year-old Bong. ""But this is (the) very first Oscar to South Korea. Thank you."" Later, as he accepted the prize for best international feature, he said in English, eliciting laughs from the audience: ""Yeah, I'm ready to drink tonight.""   Bong - who is known for his dark and genre-hopping thrillers - already had a series of critical and commercial hits behind him before Parasite and is one of South Korea's best-known faces. This latest triumph on Hollywood's biggest night, a rarity for an Asian auteur filmmaker, should take him to new heights. ""He's been an established director for close to 20 years and has made exceptional films,"" Jason Bechervaise, a professor at Korea Soongsil Cyber University, told AFP. ""He's also very charming and sociable. This has been a factor, I think, in how far the film has gone - having done hundreds of interviews, possibly more, and mingling with voters and the Hollywood elite."" ARTISTIC ELITE Bong grew up in an elite artistic family in Seoul - his maternal grandfather was a renowned novelist while his late father and all of his siblings are university professors in fields including fashion and fine art. He studied sociology at the South's prestigious Yonsei University and reportedly took part in street protests while enrolled there during the country's pro-democracy movement in the 1980s. Bong once told an interviewer he had been arrested for using petrol bombs. He was among the first wave of South Korean filmmakers to blossom after the country's full democratisation, which opened the door for a cultural renaissance. His Memories of Murder - a 2003 feature film based on real-life serial killings that rattled the nation in the 1980s - was seen as a metaphor for a repressive society under military rule. Bong's 2006 monster blockbuster The Host portrayed an incompetent government left helpless in the wake of a disaster. In 2014, parallels were drawn between the film and the Sewol ferry sinking that killed 300, mostly schoolchildren. His 2013 Snowpiercer depicted a dystopian future in which the last humans on Earth - who survived a failed attempt to stop global warming - travel endlessly on a train separated according to class, and the lower class revolts. Tilda Swinton, who was in Snowpiercer, also starred in Bong's Netflix-produced 2017 sci-fi action-adventure Okja about a country girl trying to save a genetically engineered beast from a greedy multinational firm. Quentin Tarantino - whose Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood was nominated for multiple Oscars this year - once likened the South Korean to ""Steven Spielberg in his prime"".   POLITICAL SUBTEXT Throughout his career, Bong has often tackled dark and difficult subjects including violent crime, systematic oppression and the climate crisis. He also has candidly spoken about dealing with severe anxiety, in a country where mental health has long been a taboo topic. ""All his films are sociology-in-motion, and all his films have a political subtext,"" said Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. ""They're all deeply inoculated with socially critical, political thought, without being preachy or obvious about it. Few other directors can do this."""
"Snow problem for Japan's ice sculpture festival","10/02/2020","AFP/ad","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/snow-problem-for-japan-s-ice-sculpture-festival-12416462"," SAPPORO, Japan: Every year, tens of thousands of tourists flock to the snow festival in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, attracted by some 200 large, but intricate ice sculptures. But this year, there's a problem: No snow. With high temperatures that festival-goers put down to climate change, organisers were forced to truck in powder from distant towns for their signature sculptures in an unheard-of ice crisis.   ""This lack of snow is unprecedented,"" said Yumato Sato, an official in charge of organising the snow festival, which normally uses 30,000 tonnes of the stuff for sculptures ranging from anime characters to famous racehorses. ""We had to bring in snow from places we had never reached out to before"" such as Niseko, a town about 60km away from Sapporo famous for its skiing, he said. Adding to the problem was the need for pristine snow, perfect for sculpting. ""The snow needs to be free of dirt, otherwise the sculptures can break up,"" he said. ""We barely managed to scrape together enough snow."" Record low snowfall in Japan this year has also forced many ski resorts to shut their pistes. According to Weathernews, one-quarter of the 400 resorts surveyed had been unable to operate. There has been a knock-on effect on one of the snow festival's main attractions - a 100m-long, 10m-high slide - that had to be reduced in size. 'ONCE BEFORE I DIE' Snowfall in Sapporo has been less than half the annual average, according to the Japan Meterological Agency's local observatory. High temperatures melted the snow in mid-December and the mercury is expected to stay above average. This posed a major challenge for the 125 local Self-Defense Forces troops who painstakingly construct the sculptures each year that can be as high as 15m, according to commanding officer Colonel Minoru Suzuki.   ""Due to record warm weather this year, we didn't have much snow and the snow contained more water which made the statues melt easily,"" Suzuki told AFP. His troops spent about 100 days planning and building a 15m tall, 20m wide statue modelled on the palace at Lazienki Park in Warsaw to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese-Polish diplomatic relations in 2019. ""We had to keep repairing the statue so we struggled. It was difficult to attach parts because it was so warm,"" he added. The festival has been running for 70 years and is a major tourist magnet, drawing 2.7 million visitors last year. Sunao Kinoshita, a 75-year-old who had travelled up from near Osaka, said he ""had to see it once before I die"".   ""Northern Japanese cities have been hosting snow festivals every year. It would be a shame if such events ended"" due to global warming, he said. A regular festival-goer from the region also laid the blame on global warming. ""I was worried the climate was different this year,"" Ayaka Muto, 31, told AFP. ""Usually we have more snow. I think it's strange. I feel global warming is happening,"" added Muto. 'SERIOUS AND A DISASTER' The main theme of this year's festival, which runs until Feb 11, is the ethnic Ainu minority in Hokkaido, as the first Ainu-themed national museum, nicknamed Upopoy or ""singing together"" in the Ainu language, will open in April. ""We've never before had statues with such powerful Ainu characteristics,"" Sato said.   One statue featured a giant Blakiston's fish owl spreading its wings watching over sculptures of the museum and a ship. The owl is considered a god in Ainu culture. Another statue was based on the Ainu myth of a thunder god and a forest princess. And some have been turning to the nature gods of Japan's native Shinto religion to pray for more snow. In mid-January, a ski resort in western Hyogo prefecture invited a Shinto priest to hold a ceremony to ask the gods for snow, as did the organisers of the Yamagata snow festival in northern Japan. ""It's not that we don't have enough snow. We don't have snow at all. It's serious and it's a disaster,"" Hyogo Governor Toshizo Ido told reporters last month. The Sapporo festival organisers hope they can continue the famed event in the future despite the warming climate. ""This year marked the 71st event. It's a festival that we want to carry on for future generations,"" Sato said. ""(But) this is about weather so all we can do is to pray."""
"People in Singapore support use of clean energy, want 'more ambitious climate action': NCCS study","08/02/2020","CNA/mt(cy)","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/clean-energy-singapore-nccs-study-climate-change-12410492"," SINGAPORE: People in Singapore strongly support the use of clean energy to power homes, vehicles and industries, and want ""more ambitious climate action"", the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has found. These were among the findings from a public consultation exercise conducted by the NCCS which focused on Singapore’s long-term low emissions development strategy (LEDS). The exercise saw about 2,000 submissions from businesses, community groups, and individuals. It was held from Jul 16 to Sep 30 last year, and the findings released on Friday (Feb 7). Several stakeholder engagement sessions were also organised from August last year to January 2020 to facilitate discussions with youths, green groups, green councils, academics and businesses from a variety of sectors, said NCCS, which is part of the strategy group in the Prime Minister's Office. In general, the feedback received mirrored the results from a survey also conducted by the NCCS from May to July last year, that more Singaporeans are aware of climate change and are prepared to do more, it said. When it came to the use of clean energy, respondents indicated ""strong support"" of its use to power industries, vehicles and homes, said the NCCS. Solar energy was identified as the most viable clean energy source, with suggestions including the offering of incentives and rebates to encourage solar deployment on private and building rooftops. However, some also noted that issues like intermittency and Singapore's limited land area were ""key limiting factors"" in furthering deployment. There were also mixed responses when it came to the willingness to pay a premium for clean energy, said NCCS in a summary of its findings. Several respondents pointed out the higher costs of producing cleaner energy would increase the financial burden on lower-income households, while some said that the biggest emitters should bear the most responsibility to switch to renewable energy. In terms of climate action, some called for emissions to peak well before 2030, reach net-zero by 2050, and to be in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, said NCCS. However, respondents were also aware of the challenges involved in cutting down on emissions, noted NCCS. ""Several noted that the technologies that will enable transformational shifts to a low carbon future are still in their infancy, while others cited economic competitiveness and employment concerns,"" it said. But as technologies develop, there remains the possibility to cut Singapore's emissions further. ""We are carefully considering both the calls for climate ambition and the challenges involved in developing and implementing Singapore’s LEDS,"" said NCCS. ""We agree that, as technologies develop or mature, there will be scope for greater reduction of our emissions."" NCCS also said it recognised the concerns voiced by different stakeholders. ""Addressing climate change requires a whole-of-society effort. The Government recognises the concerns from different stakeholders, and the significant effort necessary to transit to a low carbon future,"" said NCCS. ""The Government will continue to study the suggestions, convene platforms for engagement, and explore partnerships with businesses, the community and individuals to develop solutions to build a resilient and sustainable Singapore."""
"Global warming to blame for hottest day in Argentine Antarctica","08/02/2020","AFP/nh","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/global-warming-to-blame-for-hottest-day-in-argentine-antarctica-12408768"," BUENOS AIRES: Global warming is to blame for Argentine Antarctica recording its hottest day since readings began, Greenpeace said on Friday (Feb 7). Temperatures climbed to 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit) at midday Thursday at the research station Esperanza base, the highest temperature on record since 1961, according to the National Meteorological Service. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on March 24, 2015. The new record is ""of course shocking but unfortunately not surprising because Antarctica is warming up with the rest of the planet,"" said Frida Bengtsson, marine environment specialist for Greenpeace, in a statement. At Marambio, another Argentine base in Antarctica, temperatures reached 14.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the hottest temperature for a day in February since 1971. The news comes after a decade of record temperatures on the planet and a 2019 that was the second hottest year since registers have been kept. And the new decade has begun along the same tendency, with last month the hottest January on record. The effects of global warming have already seen ocean levels rise due to melting ice caps. The two largest ice caps on the planet, in Antarctica and Greenland, have already lost an average of a combined 430 billion tons a year since 2006. According to UN climate experts, the oceans rose 15 centimeters during the 20th century. It's a threat to coastal towns and small islands the world over. One of the largest glaciers in Antarctica is the Thwaites glacier, which is the size of Britain. Scientists say that if it melted it would raise sea levels by 65 centimeters. ""Over the last 30 years, the amount of ice melting off Thwaites and adjacent glaciers has nearly doubled,"" said the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration group of scientists in a statement. Argentina has had a presence in Antarctica for the past 114 years, including several scientific research bases, and is also a signatory of the Antarctic Treaty, which came into force in June 1961 and prohibits any militarization of the continent."
"Antarctic base records hottest temperature ever","07/02/2020","Reuters/nh","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctic-base-records-hottest-temperature-ever-12407530"," GENEVA/BUENOS AIRES: A research base in the Antarctic has recorded the hottest temperature ever for the continent amid rising concern about global warming that has caused an increase in the melting of ice sheets around the south pole. The Esperanza base on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula recorded a temperature of 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.94 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday. ""(This) is not a figure you would normally associate with Antarctica even in the summertime. This beat the former record of 17.5 degrees C, which was set back in 2015,"" WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis told reporters in Geneva. ""The Antarctic peninsula ... is among the fastest warming regions of the planet. We hear a lot about the Arctic, but this particular part of the Antarctic peninsula is warming very quickly."" The temperature was recorded at the Argentine base on Thursday. Scientists believe global warming has caused so much melting at the south pole that the giant ice sheet is now on course to disintegrate. This would see an eventual global sea level rise of at least three meters (10 feet) over centuries. A WMO committee will verify whether the temperature logged by Argentina's national meteorological service is a new record for the Antarctic continent. The record in the wider Antarctic region is 19.8 degrees C in January 1982. ""The amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017,"" Nullis added, citing images showing cracks in glaciers in Antarctica. ""The melting from these glaciers, you know, means we are in big trouble when it comes to sea level rise."""
"Joker's Joaquin Phoenix takes aim at climate apathy with film about dying Earth","07/02/2020","Reuters/sr","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/joker-joaquin-phoenix-climate-change-film-guardians-of-life-12402380"," Oscar favourite Joaquin Phoenix stars as a medic battling to save a dying planet Earth in a film launched on Thursday (Feb 6), the first in a series of short Hollywood productions aimed at spurring action on climate change. The Joker star teamed up with environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch, a California-based organisation campaigning to protect the Amazon rainforest, to produce the two-minute film Guardians Of Life. Shot in a Los Angeles emergency room, the movie shows doctors attempting to save an unidentified patient whose flatlining vital signs represent the threat posed by climate change, deforestation and fires from Australia to the Amazon. ""It's really a call to action,"" said Phoenix, among the most prominent Hollywood stars to draw attention to the catastrophic damage being caused by human-induced global warming. ""People don't realise there's still time, but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We can't wait for governments to solve these problems for us."" Founded in Britain, Extinction Rebellion promotes its climate activism through civil disobedience, and Phoenix was himself arrested at a climate change protest organised by fellow Hollywood star Jane Fonda in Washington last month, a few days after winning a Golden Globe for his starring role in Joker. The first in a planned series of 12 short films, Guardians Of Life points to the vital role indigenous people play in protecting habitats, a finding emphasised by scientists studying the million plant and animal species they say risk extinction due to damage caused by industrial society. ""This film is very important for us at this moment,"" said Sonia Guajajara, head of Brazil's largest indigenous umbrella organisation, the Association of Indigenous Peoples. ""It demonstrates the artists' engagement in Amazon protection by showing the key role indigenous peoples play in defending the forests, the planet, and life itself."" Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine and Oona Chaplin appear alongside Phoenix in the film. It was directed by Shaun Monson and produced with Mobilize Earth, a US not-for-profit organisation set up for the series, and aims to raise money for Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch. ""There is still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen,"" said Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion. ""But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real."" (Source: Reuters)"

"Electric future: Britain to ban new petrol and hybrid cars from 2035","04/02/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/electric-future--britain-to-ban-new-petrol-and-hybrid-cars-from-2035-12390628"," LONDON: Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. ""We have to deal with our CO2 emissions, and that is why the UK is calling for us to get to net zero as soon as possible, to get every country to announce credible targets to get there – that’s what we want from Glasgow,"" Johnson said on Tuesday at a launch event for COP26 at London's Science Museum, alongside broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. ""We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act."" The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming with responsibility for persuading big polluting countries to agree more ambitious emissions cuts falling on the British hosts. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050, but Greenpeace UK Head of Politics Rebecca Newsom said Johnson needed to take broader action than cleaning up transport. ""We need a complete rethink of the way we power our economy, build homes, move around and grow our food,"" she said. Britain's step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040 and Norway's parliament has set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars should be zero emissions. ELECTRIC VEHICLES While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail. The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest global export market for its car manufacturers, amounting to about 20per cent of global sales, and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants. The government said that, subject to consultation, it planned to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible. Diesel and petrol models still account for 90per cent of sales in Britain, and prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost. The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds (US$3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1,000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets. It has also provided investment for the development of electric vehicle technology. Johnson's launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit's former head Clare O'Neill who was sacked from the post last week. Johnson declined to answer any questions on O'Neill, but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister. A government source suggested her replacement would most likely to announced in a wider reshuffle of government posts expected this month. O'Neill, a former energy minister, accused Johnson of a lack of leadership and said he had admitted to her he did not understand climate change. ""My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises - whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed family members - is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it, and make sure the money is in the bank,"" she told BBC radio.

"Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?","01/02/2020","CNA/ml","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-koreans-evacuated-from-wuhan-12374476"," SEOUL: In the South Korean city of Asan this week, residents held angry protests decrying their government’s decision to quarantine South Koreans evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the growing outbreak of a new coronavirus, at a facility in their community. Among the many placards at the protest -- hung between pieces of heavy construction equipment to block the road to the facilities -- was one that read “Asan citizens first.” Protest signs are meant to convey simple, snappy messages and don’t have room for much context. But it was clear from this slogan that the people of Asan felt that their government should put them first, that they shouldn’t have to forego any of their interests, or risk their own health, to accommodate fellow citizens fleeing the hub of a public health crisis. In explaining their opposition, locals have said that the government picked Asan, and another city called Jincheon, as the quarantine sites without consulting them first. They have also pointed out that the quarantine facilities are in densely populated areas, where many children live. NOT IN MY BACKYARD Social scientists have dubbed this way of thinking NIMBYism, with NIMBY being the acronym for “not in my backyard,” a phenomenon whereby people in a certain location resist some change to the place that they live on no grounds other than that the proposed change, while being necessary or at least beneficial in a general sense for the wider society, isn’t good for their specific community or locality. Pretty much everyone can agree that a country must have garbage dumps and sewage treatment facilities, yet no one wants those facilities near where they live because of the adverse effects on property values and quality of life. The locals in Asan were not arguing that their fellow South Koreans should be banned from returning to their country or that the national government had no responsibility to help get them out of Wuhan. They simply, for entirely selfish reasons, want them sent elsewhere.   Curiously absent from this display of fiery dissent in Asan was any suggestion of what to do with the roughly 700 returnees. No South Korean city was likely to raise its hand and volunteer to host hundreds of people who could have been exposed to the deadly, poorly understood virus at this stage of the outbreak, when the number of cases is rising daily and no one knows how bad the outbreak could get. One might have expected that at this stage, cities would be willing to step forward and contribute to the state’s handling of the public health crisis, to shoulder risk and burden as a way of working toward a solution. A NEW FACE OF SOCIETY This case contrasts sharply with a heart-warming story of South Korean cooperation and sacrifice not too long ago. In 1998, as the country was reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis and the national government was billions of dollars in debt, citizens lined up to donate gold to help the nation climb out of debt. That story was upheld as demonstration of a deep social bond, of citizens willing to, at a time of economic disaster, give up personal assets to help out the country. Would anything like that happen today? South Koreans have long lamented that that same crisis in the late 1990s changed their country forever, introducing neoliberal economics, eroding the country’s previous model of jobs for life and family-like companies. The crisis paved the way for a more competitive, individualistic South Korea where nothing is guaranteed and average citizens, like those who protested in Asan this week, see their society’s elites as corrupt and out of touch. FOR THE WIDER GOOD South Korea is a democracy, and democracies require a peculiar balancing of individual rights and collective goals.   Citizens have a role to play in picking their leaders and agitating for policy decisions, but there are limits on what they can achieve. At some point, all citizens are asked to grit their teeth and accept things they may not like. In democracies, anyone who fulfils a duty to their state that requires they risk their own life -- career soldiers, police officers, emergency workers -- does so with their own consent. The preamble to South Korea’s constitution states, the provision of “equal opportunities to every person and provide for the fullest development of individual capabilities” as a goal. Unfortunately there is a contradiction in that, as at some point, particular individuals must sacrifice for collective well-being. LESSONS FROM THE PAST As the first chartered flight carrying 368 Koreans from Wuhan landed at the Gimpo International Airport on Friday (Jan 31) morning amidst continued anger among some residents in Asan and Jincheon, I couldn’t help but ponder about how this could messy situation could have been averted or resolved. A potentially effective solution during a dispute like this is a show of leadership, for someone in a position of responsibility to set an example for the concerned citizens of Asan by showing that they are willing to take on some of the burden. Or for someone to show by example – which in this case would have been one of the cities putting up its hands to say they would welcome their evacuated fellow citizens to be quarantined in their neighbourhood. On the other hand, the government has acted more decisively than the last time an epidemic hit the nation – the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 – by putting into quarantine and issuing medical assistance to infected persons early while also announcing that it will be drawing from an emergency fund to contain the virus as it aims to calm residents and investors.   But it can still do better. Specifically, in this case of quarantining the evacuated Koreans, it ought to clearly communicate that the authorities are working actively to contain the corona virus outbreak, and has learned lessons about the need for strict quarantine from the MERS experience, when the government garnered criticism for failing to quarantine people who had been exposed to the virus. For now, the protests appear to have simmered down as the residents of Asan reportedly came to a decision to back down after an hour-long meeting on Friday. But with more than 300 Koreans left to be evacuated from Wuhan, the unrest may yet get new life in the coming days. This makes the communication from government an ongoing effort to ease citizens’ worries. Political leadership handbooks also point to the importance of empathy, of leaders demonstrating that they care how their citizens feel. Asan citizens might feel more at ease if President Moon Jae-in came to their community to walk the city streets and listen to people’s concerns. At the very least, that would allow Moon’s government to send the key message: We’re all in this together.

"Reports of landlords evicting people on home quarantine or leave of absence 'troubling': Iswaran","31/01/2020","CNA/ga(hs)","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-landlords-evicting-quarantine-troubling-12375140"," SINGAPORE: Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said on Friday (Jan 31) that the Government has heard ""troubling or disturbing stories"" of landlords who are evicting people serving their home quarantine or taking leave of absence, as Singapore ramps up on precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus here. ""This is not the kind of response we need,"" said Mr Iswaran in a press conference, which was also attended by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority commissioner Marvin Sim. ""We are all in this together. Those on quarantine or leave of absence are subject to this for the sake of the wider community so that the rest of us do not run the risk of infection. ""We do not know how this situation will evolve and there may be other cases that need similar action. It is an overall national effort,"" said Mr Iswaran. Earlier on Friday, the World Health Organization had declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. ""This means the global community now has an even greater impetus to work together to contain the virus and then to eradicate the threat,"" said Mr Iswaran. He cited the widened travel restrictions announced by Mr Wong during the press conference, which blocks entry for new visitors with recent travel history to China, including Chinese passport holders who are not Singapore permanent residents or long-term pass holders. Singapore residents returning from China will have to take a 14-day leave of absence. The Ministry of Education said on Friday morning that nearly 1,000 students and staff are currently on leave of absence after returning from China. Other measures include the nationwide mask distribution, which starts on Saturday, as well as the use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) legislations to tackle the spread of false information. With all these measures, ""there will be some disruptions to our daily lives"", said Mr Iswaran, calling on the ""understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans"". He praised the efforts of Singaporeans who have been buying food and running errands for their neighbours who are under quarantine. “These are heart-warming efforts, and it speaks loudly of the big heart and resilient spirit of Singaporeans,” he said. “That is the spirit that we need and we want to stand together to defeat the virus and the challenge it poses. We have done it before, as with SARS, and we can do it again.” NO COMMUNITY SPREAD IN SINGAPORE There remains no community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of Friday evening. Three new cases were confirmed by MOH, one of whom was a Singaporean who was evacuated from Wuhan earlier in the week. The 13 previously confirmed cases are in stable condition and making ""good clinical progress"", said Mr Mak. None of them are critically ill, he added. Fifteen of the total confirmed cases are Chinese nationals who had travelled to the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. “To date, there’s no evidence of any local spread to any Singapore resident in Singapore and we remain watchful and vigilant to make sure that this continues to be so. Contact tracing for contacts of our local cases continues, and it is still underway,"" he said. Asked about the possibility of cancelling events such as the Singapore Air Show over virus fears, Mr Wong said scheduled events will proceed as planned but precautions will be taken. Some attendees may be prevented from showing up due to the travel restrictions, but there are no plans to cancel the Air Show at this stage, he added.

"Commentary: Thailand gives up plastic bags yet leaves rampant consumerism intact","29/01/2020","CNA/el(sl)","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/thailand-bangkok-plastic-environment-policy-climate-change-army-12323332"," LONDON: Thailand recently took an important step towards environmental protection when 75 leading retailers stopped issuing plastic bags to shoppers. This step continues a campaign started by environmentalists and local governments in Thailand to reduce urban waste and pollution. The long-term plan is to ban all single-use plastics by 2021. Thai newspapers have shown customers responding in good faith to the ban. Many are taking wheelbarrows and buckets to supermarkets, and others are re-using sacks made for transporting sugar and rice. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER? But critics ask why it has taken so long. The first bans of lightweight plastic bags took place in Bangladesh and India in 2002. China banned lightweight bags in 2008. And Thailand’s role in producing plastic waste has been known for years. A recent article in Science shows that, in terms of national averages, Thailand is the world’s sixth largest dumper of plastic. Adjusting these figures for coastal populations and coral reefs, Thailand leads the world. According to the article, Thais and visitors to Thailand will – knowingly or otherwise – throw some 8.9 million plastic items into sewers and canals by 2025, resulting in more than half a million tonnes of waste in the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea. Recent news stories in Thailand have reported occasions of animals, including a deer and baby dugong, dying from eating plastic bags.   RAMPANT CONSUMERISM Despite its late arrival, the new plastic ban is a welcome and pragmatic step. Yet too often, attempts at regulating plastic use are wrapped up in the consumerism they seek to control. From 2008 to 2010, shops in Bangkok started a temporary craze of selling reusable bags with the words “global warming” on them. Meanwhile, supermarkets in central Bangkok remain icily air-conditioned and their products overly packaged. Bangkok’s annual carbon use has risen from some 7 tonnes per person in 2005 to nearly 11 tonnes today. This is higher than London, New York City and Tokyo (but about the same as Beijing). It is also more than twice Thailand’s national carbon average of nearly 4 tonnes per person. Governments have often supported these trends. In 2012, first-time car buyers received tax breaks, choking Thailand’s already crowded streets by an additional half a million cars. One factor impeding long-term environmental planning is Thailand’s chaotic politics and military coups. These have also shaped environmentalism itself. Like other countries, Thailand’s environmentalism reflects broader worries about the impact of growth on social order and tradition.   Much historic environmentalism in Thailand focused on fears about lost wilderness and heritage. Colourful paintings on the walls of schools and public buildings often show images of bucolic rural landscapes or threatened wildlife that present the “environment” as something remote from cities. Another theme in local environmentalism is the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy promoted by the late King Bhumibol, who ruled Thailand for 70 years until his death in 2016. Sufficiency economy presents a mode of living that urges moderation and tradition. It is promoted widely in Thailand by official sources. But the US embassy once described it — in emails exposed by Wikileaks — as “vague and malleable”, popular only because of a “public reluctance to criticise anything associated with the revered King”. POPULAR ENVIRONMENTALISM Despite these limitations, environmentalism in Thailand has served an important purpose in harnessing opposition to military governments. The last military government of 2014 to 2019 banned public gatherings of more than five people and curbed other forms of dissent. Yet, in 2018, more than 1000 people gathered in Thailand’s northern capital of Chiang Mai to protest against a government luxury housing project on forested land near the revered national park and Buddhist temple of Doi Suthep. Ironically, a similar proposal was made and criticised during 1980 to 1990 by the prime minister deposed by the military in 2006, Thaksin Shinawatra. One of Thailand’s earliest environmental controversies was opposition to a proposed cable car on Doi Suthep in the 1960s.   Environmentalism has its strongest legitimacy in the public eye when it opposes what is seen as state corruption and where it involves national heritage and wilderness. So, a consequence of this pattern is that popular environmentalism might only be effective on selected topics, and that necessary restrictions on other topics such as plastics are ignored. Thailand’s new ban on plastic bags is a sign that environmental policies are becoming more effective. But there are many more steps to take. The ban needs to be enforced and extended. Climate change policy needs to adopt more efficient and renewable sources of energy. Replacing fossil fuels with technologies such as hydrogen cells and solar panels are priorities for public transport and home heating, and so are addressing excessive packaging and air conditioning. What is needed is a root-and-branch rethinking of environmental priorities and an awareness that much popular environmentalism tends to romanticise Thailand’s past rather than think pragmatically about its future.

"Commentary: When it comes to climate change, Japan’s leaders need to walk the talk","25/01/2020","CNA/ml","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/is-japan-delivering-on-climate-change-nuclear-oil-fossil-fuels-12311532"," TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly pledged that his country would lead global efforts to address climate change. Increasingly, however, Japan is facing scrutiny over the gap between its lofty rhetoric and the reality of its climate policies, which include on-going support for coal-fired power, and inadequate emission reduction targets. Shinjiro Koizumi, the environment minister, mounted only a half-hearted defence of Japan’s policy mix when he told the COP25 climate summit in Madrid last month that he was aware of global criticism and added: A growing number of people in Japan, including myself, believe further climate actions must be taken. The calls – from inside and outside government – for more ambitious policy moves come at a critical time. This year, Japan, like other Paris Agreement signatories, will be urged to review and ideally increase its emission pledges ahead of the November climate conference in Glasgow. MORE CUTS NEEDED So how, exactly, is Japan falling short? For starters, analysts say its near-term target isn’t consistent with the scale of cuts required to prevent more damaging climate impacts. Japan is pledging to reduce emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 compared with 2013 levels – a baseline year in which fossil fuel use had spiked, in part because the country’s nuclear reactors went offline after the 2011 Fukushima meltdowns. The website Climate Action Tracker, made up of a consortium of climate research institutes and consultants, rates the target as “highly insufficient”, noting that it is actually closer to 23 per cent once credits for land use and forestry measures are excluded, while warning “if all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming could reach over 3 degrees Celsius and up to 4 degrees Celsius.” The globe has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, Japan and other signatories committed to holding the global temperature rise this century to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and “to pursue efforts” to limit it to just 1.5 degrees Celsius.   While 1.5 degrees of warming will increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth, these risks will grow even further with 2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC notes that globally, carbon dioxide emissions must decline by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In other words, the coming decade is vital. WALK THE TALK If Japan wants to lead global efforts, as Abe claims, it could consider adopting a more ambitious near-term target to help gain the credibility needed to encourage other major emitters to act. At the moment, however, Japan’s plans for its energy sector this decade continue to place a significant emphasis on fossil fuels while embracing a gradual shift to renewables. Coal, LNG and oil are still projected to account for a combined 56 per cent of Japan’s energy mix in 2030, confirming Japan’s on-going status as a major export market for Australian coal and gas. Renewables, meanwhile, are pegged at about 22 per cent to 24 per cent in 2030 – a goal that Taro Kono, the defence minister, has previously criticised as lamentably low. Nuclear power is earmarked to supply 20 per cent to 22 per cent of the energy mix at the end of the decade, even though the reopening of reactors has been slowed by tighter regulatory checks and legal challenges post-Fukushima. COAL TREATMENT While several coal-fired power station projects have been cancelled over the last couple of years, units with capacity totalling 13 gigawatts are either planned or already under construction across the country, according to the Japan Coal Plant Tracker.   Japan is also financing or providing other support for coal-fired power station projects abroad, via public entities such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Koizumi was reported by Japanese media to have pushed for tighter curbs on coal power plant exports in the lead-up to the climate conference last month but was blocked amid resistance from the industry ministry. He alluded to his disappointment when he informed COP25 delegates that he was afraid he was unable to share any new developments regarding coal policy. In the longer term, Japan is pledging to achieve net zero emissions “as early as possible in the second half of this century”, a vague timeframe that leaves plenty of wiggle room for delayed transformation across what is the world’s third-largest economy. Again, the IPCC has indicated that the 1.5-degrees Celsius warming limit could be out of reach unless global carbon dioxide emissions fall to net zero by around 2050. Japan’s strategy looks tentative compared with those of the United Kingdom, which passed a law last year requiring it to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, and the European Union, which also is aiming for mid-century. Japan’s long-term strategy highlights the country’s potential strengths as it moves to decarbonise the economy and emphasises the need for “disruptive innovation”. With a significant automotive industry, for example, Japan can win from the rising use of electric vehicles, and Japan is also eyeing opportunities from hydrogen – a potential area of cooperation with Australia. But all of this needs to be underpinned by decisive political leadership to build momentum in international climate negotiations. Abe says he wants to lead. This year, he has a chance to prove it.

The spat between US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Thunberg again highlighted the tensions over climate change at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where governments have come under pressure to act on global warming as well as talk about the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday also said in a keynote address that governments were obliged to act on the younger generation's concerns over climate change. Mnuchin had earlier advised Thunberg, who has been bitterly critical of US policy during her stay at Davos, to study economics before giving out lessons.   Asked about the 17-year-old's demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels, he told reporters: ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us."" But in a thread of tweets, Thunberg dismissed Mnuchin's comments in a typically withering response. ""My gap year ends in August, but it doesn't take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5 degrees carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don't add up,"" she wrote. ""So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments,"" she added. In her speech to the forum, Merkel said that older politicians had to use the ""positive manner and constructive impatience of young people"", who she said ""have a completely different horizon"" in terms of time. She did not however in her speech mention Thunberg, who other than Britain's Prince Charles has met relatively few top leaders at the forum. 'WE WANT THIS DONE NOW' In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump had castigated the ""prophets of doom"" and those that predicted a climate ""apocalypse"", in comments widely seen as an attack on Thunberg who sat in the audience. But either by accident or design, there was no meeting between Trump and Thunberg before the US leader left the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday declaring he would have ""loved"" to have met the climate activist, Time magazine's Person of the Year. Thunberg at the forum had repeated her climate warnings in sometimes withering terms, hammering home in a speech that it was time to ""panic"" because ""the house is burning"". Notably she had called for an immediate halt to investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and an end to fossil fuel subsidies ""We don't want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now,"" she said. Thunberg is to hold a ""school strike"" demonstration in Davos on Friday. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told AFP during the forum that governments were still failing to act on climate change. Attending the summit was like being at a ""crime scene where all of the criminals are right there in front of you,"" she said. ""But these are the targets. These are the people who have to change."""
"Davos financiers pump US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels: Greenpeace","21/01/2020","AFP/ec","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/davos-financiers-pump-us-1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels-12296738","  PARIS: Some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested US$1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal, Greenpeace said on Tuesday (Jan 21) at the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. With the climate emergency expected to be front and centre at the annual summit of the world's business elite, the charity accused some institutions in attendance of failing to live up to the Forum's goal of ""improving the state of the world"". Greenpeace analysed the portfolios of 24 of the banks represented at Davos and found that they had financed the fossil fuel industry to the tune of US$1.4 trillion since the landmark 2015 Paris deal. That accord enjoins nations to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" two degrees Celsius through a rapid and wide-ranging drawdown of planet-warming carbon emissions. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on the subject - says that for a better-than-even chance of reaching the safer Paris cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius, oil and gas consumption would need to decline 37 per cent and 25 per cent respectively by 2030. The IPCC says coal use must fall two thirds by 2030 and fall to virtually zero by mid-century to keep Earth on a 1.5-Celsius path. Yet carbon emissions are growing every year as global energy demand surges, and the International Energy Association said Monday that fossil fuel companies are still only investing 0.8 per cent of their spending in renewables. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said financial institutions were complicit in climate change by funding the fuels that drive it. ""Banks, insurers and pension funds are as culpable for the climate emergency as the fossil fuel industry - specifically those that go to Davos,"" Morgan told AFP. ""These Davos players say they support the Paris agreement but since its signing they've pumped US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels."" 'PROPPING UP DIRTY ENERGY' The Greenpeace report found that just 10 banks had provided US$1 trillion to fossil fuels since Paris. That same amount could pay to double the world's solar power capacity. It also identified three pension funds with at least US$26 billion in fossil fuel holdings, and alleged that four of the world's biggest insurance firms - AIG, Prudential, Sompo and Tokio marine - had no publicly disclosed policies to divest from fossil fuels. ""The fossil fuel industry needs the finance sector but its not the same the other way around, so why are these bank, insurers and pensions propping up dirty energy?"" asked Morgan, who will be participating in the four-day Davos forum. Last year green groups issued the Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card, identifying a rise in funding for coal, oil and gas each year since Paris was signed. ""The massive scale at which global banks continue to pump billions of dollars into fossil fuels is flatly incompatible with a liveable future,"" said Alison Kirsh, climate and energy lead researcher at Rainforest Action Network."
"Climate change pushes investors to take their temperature","20/01/2020","Reuters","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-pushes-investors-to-take-their-temperature-12289500"," LONDON: Move over revenue growth and dividend payouts: it's time to take your portfolio's temperature. Policymakers are pushing investors to do more to ensure their portfolio choices help to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change by limiting planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5C. A vanguard of insurers and pension funds, many of whom will be in Davos this week for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, say part of the answer is a new ""temperature score"" that gives a snapshot of how their investments are contributing to climate change. A single score, they say, can help them navigate the reallocation of capital from heavily polluting sectors of the global economy likely to take a financial hit to greener companies poised to profit. So far, the temperature metric has been adopted by only a handful of the thousands of financial institutions worldwide but the buzz it has generated shows how investors' concerns about climate risk are finally moving into the mainstream. ""There's still a massive amount of work to be done on this but it's very encouraging that we as an industry are being forced to answer this temperature score question,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management. ""If you thought you could ignore climate change before, you just can't anymore."" France is leading the way with 18 firms, including insurer AXA and reinsurer Scor, disclosing the temperature score of all or part of their portfolios in 2018. British regulators have flagged that they could require some banks and insurers to report temperature scores from 2021 in annual portfolio stress tests. Asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen, German reinsurer Munich Re, Swiss rival Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance all told Reuters they were considering assigning temperature scores to their portfolios. INCREMENTAL INDICATOR Temperature scores are one of several investor-led initiatives to spring up in the last few years as policymakers crank up the pressure on the financial industry to accelerate change. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European body of mainly pension funds and asset managers with 30 trillion euros (US$33 trillion) of combined assets under management, launched an initiative in May to work out how members can use their financial clout to back the Paris goals. That was followed by the launch of the ""Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance"" at a U.N. climate summit in September. The group, which has so far signed up 16 insurers and pension funds with combined assets of almost US$4 trillion, has pledged to align investments with the most ambitious Paris temperature targets. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, last week announced an overhaul of the way it approaches climate risk. Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the ""strongest foundation"" for client portfolios. Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with US$25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development. ""This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition,"" David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters. TRICKY CALCULATION Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number. Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager Schroders, said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be ""robust and logical"". ""There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work,"" he said. Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their ""carbon intensity"" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue. A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time. Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C. ""The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like,"" said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores. The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers. Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer. ""A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits,"" said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI. ""You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future."" STRANDED ASSETS Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years. The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory. Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy. Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities. Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as ""warming potentials"" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions. ""Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,"" said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month. The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz British rival Aviva and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C. AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C. ""The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?"" he said. ""We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down.""
