Climate change could make premiums unaffordable: QBE Insurance=17 Feb 2020 01:36PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-could-make-premiums-unaffordable--qbe-insurance-12441584=" SYDNEY: Australia's QBE Insurance Group said on Monday climate change could make some premiums unaffordable, especially for customers exposed to extreme weather events, and was a "material risk" for its operations across the globe. During 2019, QBE's net Australia-Pacific cost of catastrophe claims jumped to US$193 million from US$106 million the year before, led by unprecedented floods in Australia's north east coast and horrendous bushfires across the country's south east. The insurer said it has started to adjust its catastrophe models to factor in the expected impacts of climate change until 2100, and would assess the impact on its weather-related exposures from emissions and temperatures. In the short-term, QBE would manage higher claims by considering event frequency and severity in its capital planning and will deploy a comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program, it said. Over the long-term, it expected the physical impacts of climate change "will result in our customers seeking increased insurance for the protection of their assets and the services they provide." "This may cause insurance premiums to become unaffordable, especially for customers in areas more exposed to weather-related events, potentially resulting in a loss of revenue." Insurers and banks are also facing stricter regulatory scrutiny over their response to global warming, with shareholders expecting better disclosures and transparency on climate-related risks. In its annual climate disclosure, QBE said it plans to phase out all direct insurance services for thermal coal customers by 2030, in an effort to cut emissions responsible for rising global temperatures. It is also committed to shunning direct insurance services for new thermal coal mines, power stations or thermal coal transport infrastructure. Globally, the economic costs from natural disasters have exceeded the 30?year average for seven of the last 10 years, while the number of extreme weather events globally has tripled since the 1980s, QBE CEO Pat Regan said in the company's annual report.

UN's Guterres calls for 'transformational change' on climate=17 Feb 2020 01:46AM=AFP/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/un-s-guterres-calls-for--transformational-change--on-climate-12440330=" ISLAMABAD: Governments must deliver decisive actions and "transformational change" to combat global warming, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday (Feb 16), blasting a recent climate summit in Madrid. The so-called COP25 climate talks in the Spanish capital in December were supposed to build on breakthrough promises made at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. Instead, governments equivocated and observers decried their response as inadequate and unambitious. "Our planet is burning but too many decision makers continue to fiddle," Guterres said in a speech he delivered in Islamabad. "The only answer is decisive climate action ... Gradual approaches are no longer enough." A United Nations panel concluded late in 2018 that avoiding global climate chaos will require a major transformation of society and the world economy. The landmark report said global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030, and reach "net zero" by 2050, to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the safe cap set as a goal in the Paris accord. Guterres said that at the next climate conference, the COP26 in Glasgow later this year, "governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition." Guterres said rich countries should lead the way, including by ending "perverse" fossil fuel subsidies. Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to intensify their efforts. The summit was at times close to collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests. Guterres credited Pakistan for banning plastic bags in the capital Islamabad and for a large tree-planting programme. Guterres is in Pakistan for a three-day visit that will include his attendance at a conference on Pakistan's hosting of Afghan refugees for 40 years. Pakistan is one of the largest refugee-hosting nations in the world, home to an estimated 2.4 million registered and undocumented people who have fled Afghanistan, some as far back as the Soviet invasion of 1979. Many live in camps, while others have built lives for themselves in Pakistan's cities, paying rent and contributing to the economy. Guterres said the "preferred, durable solution for the refugees has always been one-time repatriation with safety and dignity to the country of origin"."
Antarctica registers record temperature of over 20 degrees Celsius=14 Feb 2020 08:17AM (Updated: 14 Feb 2020 08:38AM)=AFP=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctica-registers-record-temperature-of-over-20-degrees-12434124=" SAO PAULO: Scientists in Antarctica have recorded a new record temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius, breaking the barrier of 20 degrees for the first time on the continent, a researcher said on Thursday (Feb 13). "We'd never seen a temperature this high in Antarctica," Brazilian scientist Carlos Schaefer told AFP. He cautioned that the reading, taken at a monitoring station on an island off the continent's northern tip on Feb 9, "has no meaning in terms of a climate-change trend", because it is a one-off temperature and not part of a long-term data set. But news that the icy continent is now recording temperatures in the relatively balmy twenties is likely to further fuel fears about the warming of the planet. The reading was taken at Seymour Island, part of a chain off the peninsula that curves out from the northern tip of Antarctica. The island is home to Argentina's Marambio research base. Schaefer, a soil scientist, said the reading was taken as part of a 20-year-old research project on the impact of climate change on the region's permafrost. The previous high was in the 19s, he said. "We can't use this to anticipate climatic changes in the future. It's a data point," he said. "It's simply a signal that something different is happening in that area." Still, he added, a temperature that high had never been registered in Antarctica. Accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially ice sheets in Antarctica is helping drive sea level rises, threatening coastal megacities and small island nations. The news came a week after Argentina's National Meteorological Service recorded the hottest day on record for Argentine Antarctica: 18.3 degrees Celsius at midday at the Esperanza base, located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on Mar 24, 2015, it said. It has been recording Antarctic temperatures since 1961. The past decade has been the hottest on record, the United Nations said last month, with 2019 the second-hottest year ever, after 2016. And 2020 looks set to continue the trend: Last month was the hottest January on record."
Japan needs to apologise more, China needs to say thank you more, says famed prof=13 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 13 Feb 2020 09:07AM)=CNA/dp=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/japan-apologise-china-say-thank-you-us-harvard-prof-ezra-vogel-12429600=" SINGAPORE: He has spent six decades studying China and Japan, a time span that is only 15 years shy of the end of World War II. In that time, the old wounds of Japanese war atrocities in China have yet to heal. And the question of whether Japan needs to apologise in the way Germany has is never far away. Ezra Vogel, the famed 89-year scholar and Harvard University emeritus professor of social sciences, does not think it would change China’s basic foreign policy considerations. But he agrees that Japan needs “to apologise more”. He also thinks China needs “to say thank you more” — because the Japanese became major contributors of foreign aid to the Chinese after they signed their Treaty of Peace and Friendship.   “The Japanese feel that ... (they) were very generous, after 1978, in helping China. They were giving more aid, more technological assistance, to China than any other country,” he says. “That was given instead of reparations, and the Chinese leaders acknowledged privately at the time that that’s what the meaning was. But the Chinese (leaders) haven’t done so much publicly, and many Chinese are completely unaware of that.” Fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, he has produced bestsellers like Japan As Number One and an authoritative, 900-page tome on Deng Xiaoping. He has even been criticised for being an unabashed admirer of Tokyo and Beijing. For the record, he says he is not an East Asian apologist. Few in the West, however, know those countries better.   And ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan in April — his first and one that experts say is a remarkable warming of bilateral relations — Prof Vogel gives his take on their relationship and also on Sino-American ties. That includes the question of whether Beijing is trying to tug Japan out of Washington’s grasp by cosying up to Tokyo. BETTER TIES LIKELY, BUT NOT BFFs Just a few years ago, China and Japan had a bitter territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. And although Prof Vogel reckons that relations are likely to improve now, he doubts that the Japanese will “feel comfortable being real friends”. “They saw the pictures of Japanese businesses being trashed on television (and of) Chinese planes and ships ... near the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands (in 2013),” he cites. “They look at the movies of WWII, which the Japanese have seen on television from China ... And (they’re) worried that if Chinese domestic problems should get very serious ... it would be quite popular in China to become anti-Japanese again.”   If they would “put in their textbooks more about the horrors they’ve done”, and be more apologetic, he thinks it would make them less vulnerable to Chinese criticism. “When things are tense, China can always pull out the lack of apology to create problems with Japan,” he notes. Many younger Japanese, however, are “tired” of hearing the same old thing. “They say, ‘Why should I apologise for things that happened before I was born?’ And they say, ‘We’ve apologised already. Why’s China pushing us?’” says the professor. “The Japanese know they did bad things in WWII. They realise a lot of countries have done bad things. And they want to improve relations. But they don’t feel that they’re uniquely bad people.”   Mr Xi’s current overtures to Japan come not only a few years after bilateral tensions had been heightened, but also a decade after China overtook Japan as the world’s second-largest economy. That has since meant a “readjustment” of their relationship. “(The Chinese) feel that they’re now in a strong position, that the power they worry about isn’t Japan but the US,” says Prof Vogel. And because China is Japan’s largest trading partner, and Japan is China’s second-largest trading partner after the US, “there’s a very deep interlinkage”. So he thinks an improvement in ties is the likely outcome in April. “The Japanese have a slogan: That the economics between China and Japan are hot, and the politics are cold. I think the politics can become lukewarm,” he adds. “They can calm things down and have better working relationships.”   But they do not “feel confident that they can rely on China to remain friends over a long period” — even if, as some commentators say, Mr Xi is attempting to slowly move Japan away from the US. “If I were Japanese and thinking where my dangers are coming from in the future, I don’t think I’d worry about what the US would do to me. But I’d worry about what the Chinese might do,” says Prof Vogel. “There’s no way the Japanese military budget can compare with China’s in future. In that situation, I think the Japanese still feel that if there were some kind of emergency or difficult issue, they’d want to rely on the US.” And that means keeping a deep defence relationship with the US.   NO CONSENSUS ON CHINA China’s economy is also poised to surpass that of the US — in the next 10 years, say some forecasters. But the problem with their relationship “is much deeper and is going to be harder to resolve”, says Prof Vogel. “(The US) feels that it’s the strongest power in the world. And (there are) those who feel it’s their responsibility to defend our country against any other country, especially one that’s communist, authoritarian and doesn’t respect human rights,” he adds. “The American people feel that this is a very different kind of country ... particularly since China has been advancing and building little islands in the South China Sea.” One of the big questions now is whether there will be a single, integrated global economy, or a split between the Chinese and US economies. The signs are ominous. “Many of the American companies that felt they were working with China quite well feel that they’re no longer as welcome, and that the Chinese government helps (Chinese) firms and makes things very difficult,” says Prof Vogel. “Google can’t operate in China the way it operates in the US. So there’s a feeling in America that (the Chinese) haven’t played by the same kind of rules.”   According to him, however, many of those who study China feel that the Chinese “have done far more to adapt”, and that the mood in Washington is “overblown”. There are far more people in China we can work with, and we feel that we have to work with them in a much more positive way — that if we treat them like an enemy, they can become an enemy. This view of his had prompted him, together with a group of diplomats and other academics, to write an open letter to US President Donald Trump last year, titled China Is Not The Enemy. This came about a year after an “influential article” in the Foreign Affairs magazine said engagement has not worked, which seemed to embody a Washington consensus that China “was something to worry about” and unite against.   Although there are not only Republicans, but also “a lot of Democrats who believe that”, Prof Vogel argues that a fair portion of Americans do not share that sentiment. Even the friends he grew up with in a small town in the Midwest “have different ideas about China”. “The anti-Chinese mood is much stronger in Washington than it is in America as a whole,” he says. “There’s a kind of frustration on the one hand and ... political opportunism, on the other hand, of congressmen and some people in Washington who hope to get jobs in future administrations (and) find it in their interests to be very tough on China.” Those who are like him, however, believe that China, the US and the world “would be better served by finding ways in which we can work with each other”. “There are many of us who hope that we can put America on a better path, but we don’t know (if we can),” he says.

Britain's COP26 climate talks 'can't fail': UK's energy minister=12 Feb 2020 11:36PM=AFP/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/britain-s-cop26-climate-talks-can-t-fail-uk-s-energy-minister-12428378=" PARIS: The world can't afford for crunch climate talks this year to fail, Britain's energy minister said Wednesday (Feb 12), despite the government not having named a leader for the summit starting in November. Speaking at an International Energy Agency (IEA) event in Paris, Kwasi Kwarteng said that the COP26 climate negotiations would be the "top international priority" for his government despite it occurring just weeks before the Brexit negotiation period is due to expire. "We can't guarantee success," Kwarteng told country and industry representatives at the IEA. "What I can commit to is that this is absolutely our number one priority as a government. "I'm confident it will be a success because we really can't afford it to be a failure, not just on a global level. It's also on a national level given where we are with Brexit and other issues," Kwarteng added. The COP26 talks in November are the final negotiating session before the landmark 2015 Paris climate deal goes into effect. The accord saw nations pledge to limit global temperature rises to "well-below" two degrees Celsius and to work towards a safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius. To do so greenhouse gas emissions need to fall sharply - 7.6 per cent annually by 2030, according to the latest United Nations estimate. The IEA said Tuesday that emissions from energy, which account for the majority of manmade carbon pollution, had flatlined in 2019 after two successive annual increases. "2019 is potentially an inflexion point but we have to work very hard to ensure it represents a peak number and not simply a staging post to even more emissions," said Kwarteng. He was speaking several days after Britain's original choice for COP26 president, former energy minister Claire O'Neill, was removed from the role. She responded with scathing criticism of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet's handling of preparations. In a letter to Johnson leaked to the Financial Times, she warned: "We are miles off track. "You promised to 'lead from the front' and asked me what was needed 'money, people, just tell us!'. Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met." O'Neill said that a COP26 planning sub-committee had not met once in the months since she was appointed, and told the BBC she believed Johnson "really doesn't understand" climate change. With just 1C of warming above pre-industrial levels so far, the world is already experiencing record heatwaves, wildfires and storm surges made worse by rising seas. The COP26 in Glasgow is the last chance for countries to accelerate their plans for voluntary emissions cuts. Current pledges have Earth on course to warm more than 3 degrees Celcius by 2100."
BP boss Looney 'reinvents' oil giant with zero carbon goal=12 Feb 2020 11:31PM (Updated: 12 Feb 2020 11:35PM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/bp-boss-looney--reinvents--oil-giant-with-zero-carbon-goal-12428396=" LONDON: BP plans deep cuts to its carbon emissions by 2050, setting one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets, as part of the biggest overhaul in the company's 111-year history by new chief executive Bernard Looney. The targets set out by Looney on Wednesday put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell , Total , Equinor and all of the U.S. oil majors. "We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society’s expectations of us," he said in his first major speech as CEO. "We need to reinvent BP," he said earlier in a statement. BP did not specify how it intends to reach its 2050 targets to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, which include diesel or petrol. Smaller Spanish rival Repsol has set similar net zero carbon targets for the oil products it sells, also known as Scope 3, at a cost of more than US$5 billion. This does not include emissions from products it markets but which were produced by other groups, Repsol said. The huge scale of BP's operations puts its aims at the vanguard in oil and gas. BP has tried reinventing itself before. A pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s ended with huge losses. Since then, the world's top oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. "The world’s carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. We all want energy that is reliable and affordable, but that is no longer enough. It must also be cleaner," Looney added. Shares in BP were up 1.3per cent at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January. BP's absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets but does not produce itself. This is a uniquely structured target for oil majors, which, apart from Repsol, have not set any absolute reduction targets for any of its Scope 3 emissions. BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut its emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. A spokesman said near-term plans would be published by a September investor day. One way of reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets is to offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology which is not yet used at a commercial scale. U.S. groups such as Exxon , Chevron and ConocoPhillips are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. (Graphic: Oil majors&apos; carbon emissions png - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QEMZ7NW/eikon.png) Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms. Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls. Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. Greenpeace said BP's plan left many questions unanswered. "How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?," Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, said. 'NEW EXPECTATIONS' BP will set "new expectations" for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit them if they are not aligned. Last year, BP invested around US$500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of US$15.2 billion in 2019. In one of its biggest-ever changes, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit. "We need to become more integrated and more focused," Looney said. A new production and operations unit, which include oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal, while innovation and engineering will be led by David Eyton.

Shareholder activists test JPMorgan's Dimon on climate proposals=12 Feb 2020 11:15PM (Updated: 12 Feb 2020 11:15PM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/shareholder-activists-test-jpmorgan-s-dimon-on-climate-proposals-12428330=" BOSTON/NEW YORK: Shareholder activists focused on climate issues vowed to press proxy battles with JPMorgan Chase & Co after getting a cold reception from the top Wall Street bank, even though Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has vowed to protect the environment. Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending. JPMorgan's position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday. "They're not walking their talk," said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview. She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency's website, JPMorgan argued that her group's request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to "micromanage" the company. "I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there’s no way you can talk to us about anything," Fugere said. JPMorgan representatives did not immediately comment. Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also targeted other banks and energy companies with climate proposals this year and hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc to put more focus on environmental issues. Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks. Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a "statement of corporate purpose," arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment.

Pope dismisses proposal to ordain married men as priests in Amazon=12 Feb 2020 07:20PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-dismisses-proposal-to-ordain-married-men-as-priests-in-amazon-12427450=" VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, in one of the most significant decisions of his papacy, on Wednesday (Feb 12) dismissed a proposal to allow some married men to be ordained in the Amazon region to ease an acute scarcity of priests. The recommendation, put forward by Latin American bishops last year, had alarmed conservatives in the deeply polarised 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, who feared it could lead to a change in the centuries-old commitment to celibacy among priests. Francis delivered his response in an Apostolic Exhortation, three months after the proposal passed by 128 votes to 41 at a contentious Vatican assembly, or synod, of Roman Catholic bishops. Apostolic Exhortations are used to instruct and encourage the Catholic faithful but do not define Church doctrine. Wednesday's 32-page document did not even mention the proposal, which was for older married deacons who are proven leaders of remote Catholic communities and have stable families to be ordained as priests. Conservatives balked, fearing that even a circumscribed change would be a slippery slope leading to a married priesthood throughout the Church. They branded a pre-synod working document as heretical. In what some viewed as a strategically timed appeal to Francis not to approve the Amazon proposal, a book published last month by Church conservatives defended the tradition of priestly celibacy. "From the Depths of Our Hearts" was co-authored by Cardinal Robert Sarah and Former Pope Benedict, though Francis' predecessor subsequently disassociated himself from the project. Vatican officials said the pope completed the document on Dec. 27, before the book controversy, and handed it in for translations. They said no changes were made after that. In the Exhortation, the 82-year-old Argentine pope wrote, new ways must be found to encourage more priests to work in the remote region, and allow expanded roles for lay people and permanent deacons, of whom the Amazon needed "many more". Deacons, like priests, are ordained ministers. They can preach, teach, baptise and run parishes, but they cannot say Mass. Married men can become deacons. Because only priests can say Mass, people in at least 85% of Amazon villages cannot attend the liturgy every week and some cannot do so for years. "This urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America ... to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region," he wrote. He used the first three chapters of the document to defend the rights and legacies of indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon, which had to be protected because of its vital role in mitigating global warming. Conservatives feared that if Francis had taken up the proposal, other areas with a shortage of priests would follow, even in developed countries such as Germany, where the issue is being discussed."

In fire-hit rural Australia, climate debate burns deep==Reuters/jt=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/in-fire-hit-rural-australia--climate-debate-burns-deep-12422084=" BUCHAN, Australia: Returning from a morning feeding his sheep, Jeff McCole, a 70-year-old farmer, paused to take in the bittersweet scene – a few droplets of rain falling onto the remains of his fire-ravaged home. "Nothing like the sound of rain on a tin roof," he said, as he scanned the residue of a lifetime of memories scattered before him. By the old front door was a charred metal toy truck his grandchildren once raced down the verandah. Under the remains of the tin roof, a collection of books, his wife's "pride and joy", had been reduced to layers of feathery ash. And out back, the skeleton of a Valencia orange tree, planted by his mother 65 years ago, was now laden with baubles of charcoaled fruit.   Seasonal bushfires have struck Australia in a way like never before, making for months of monster blazes and toxic haze, and fuelling a polarising debate over climate change. But in Buchan, a conservative-voting farming town in Victoria state that is home to the McCole farm, most locals said they believed the catastrophic fires had nothing to do with global warming. Climate change was "a load of crap", said McCole, an idea pushed by city folk with "no experience in the bush" and no understanding of Australia's punishing, cyclical climate. "We've had severe droughts and everything like that, 70 years ago," said McCole, a Vietnam war veteran with sky-blue eyes. "It just keeps going around in circles. If you wait, it's going to change." RISING RISKS For decades scientists have warned that climate change would increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia. This year, there was the perfect storm – record-breaking drought and heat coalescing on tinderbox land. Before rains slowed their spread in recent days, the fires had burned through almost 12 million hectares, destroyed more than 2,800 homes, and claimed the lives of 33 people. An estimated one billion native animals are also believed to have died. Australia has one of the world's highest carbon footprints per capita and is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas, making successive governments reluctant to adopt climate change policies they say could undermine the economy. But with these unprecedented bushfires, the government has come under increased pressure from environmental groups, scientists and broader swathes of the Australian public to address the climate change issue. "People are more fearful of the future because they glimpsed the future this summer," said Lesley Hughes, a professor and climate scientist at Macquarie University. "I think it has been really wounding of the Australian psyche."   Polling by the Australia Institute, a Canberra think tank, in January found that 79 per cent of Australians said they were concerned about climate change, up five percentage points from last July, with 47per cent "very concerned", a jump of 10 points. But there remains widespread scepticism that the severity of the fires is due to climate change, with many conservative politicians and media suggesting that factors such as arson, the length of cyclical droughts or poor management of flammable vegetation are more responsible. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had previously declined to discuss the link between climate change and the fires, recently acknowledged the connection, but said his priority was managing the economic impact. Morrison last week cited "hazard reduction" – which includes the practice of controlled burns to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the bush, as a key to mitigating fires in the future, saying it was just as important as reducing emissions. Climate scientists say that the bigger problem for Australia are longer droughts and increasingly hot summers.   The issue of controlled burns is a deeply emotional one in Buchan, where at least 20 homes were lost in the fires that struck in December. "Climate change or not," said Donald Graham, a farmer who survived the fires huddled in his concrete bunker with a stack of cheese and vegemite sandwiches. "These fires were a disaster waiting to happen." A DEATH TRAP The road from Melbourne to Buchan winds past a series of small country towns, pie shops and historic churches and, after a weekend of rain, verdant green fields with dairy cows. But closer to Buchan, population 385, the road is eerily burnt out, lined by rows of black tree trunks sticking out of ashy ground. When the bushfires hit the town on Dec. 30, they roared in on three fronts with a ferocity that no locals had ever seen. For more than a month, fires had raged ominously in nearby bushland, finally bellowing in with "one heck of a red glow", McCole said.   From the verandah of his home, nestled on a 400-hectare property of rolling hills, gum trees and Merino sheep, he watched a giant orange plume crest over the hill and rain down fiery embers. "We only had ten minutes to get out and I think that was the best call I ever made," he said with a wry laugh. "It was a death trap." The town of Buchan is a single main street with a general store and a pub - the kind of place where locals have time to discuss the pressing issues of the day with a stranger. "The issue of climate change and the fire is a dead duck as far as I'm concerned," said Graham, an animated 68-year-old cattleman with a shock of gray hair. "What is the most significant thing, is the changing structure of the forest." Minutes before he watched his house go up in flames from the peephole of his bunker, Graham raced inside to grab a picture from the wall, a colonial lithograph featuring the magnificent valley below overlooking the confluence of the Snowy and Buchan rivers.   The picture is significant because it shows how much the land has changed, he said. "We've got an accumulation of vegetation. Our area was burned 50 to 70 years ago and it has not burned since, and at some point it will burn," he said. "It just needs a few things to come together, a few dry years and some lightning and neither of those are peculiar to the Australian landscape." His neighbour John Coates, a 76-year-old cattle farmer, said that decades of vegetation growth had turned the land into a "timebomb". Walking through their property overlooking the Snowy River National Park, Coates and his wife Janice shook their heads at the destruction – bald, blackened hills and the devastated gorge below, once filled with ferns, lyrebirds and platypus in the creek. Many locals in Buchan recall the days they would carry a box of matches in their pockets so they could carry out their own hazard-reduction burns. But regulations subsequently put in place aimed at protecting state forests and bushland mean they are now dependent on government agencies for carrying out controlled burns. For years, local farmers had urged the government to carry out burns to reduce the "fuel load", or the accumulation of trees, underbrush and dry grass that can turn a small bushfire into an inferno, Coates said. But it never happened.   Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer for Forest Fire Management Victoria, said in a statement to Reuters that his agency had planned to burn 246,396 hectares of the state's public land last year, but was "unable to do so because it would have been unsafe". Scientists also say the drought and increasingly hot weather means there are fewer days that vegetation can be safely burned. Commenting on the issue in New South Wales, Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said it was not a case of failing to implement techniques that had worked in the past, but that such techniques were "insufficient to address the scenario now". "You can't blame the dry conditions and say it has no relevance to climate change," he said. "It's a combination of many different climatic changes that can be linked back to the overall trend." SEASONS 'OUT OF SYNC' In Buchan, not everyone in town was averse to talk of climate change – a few spoke of the seasons being "out of sync", the lack of rain or the demise of fragrant yellow box flowers in the valley. But the fires have mainly reinforced pre-existing views and gripes, reflecting the polarising rhetoric of the national climate change debate. Last November, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack – who heads the party that won in the electorate that includes Buchan – described climate change concerns as those held by "inner-city raving lunatics".   That messaging appeared to resonate in Buchan, far from the skyscrapers and the lights of Melbourne or Sydney, with a strong sense that people here were living far greener lives. "They blame our cows," said McCole, referring to recent attention on the earth-warming methane produced by belching or flatulent cattle. But, he said, "they are all jumping on electric trains and cars and god knows what in the city and there are millions of them, flying around the world in jumbo jets." "It takes a good cow to put out that many emissions," he said. "I can tell ya.""
Bong Joon-ho: South Korea's boundary-pushing satirist=10 Feb 2020 01:10PM (Updated: 10 Feb 2020 02:00PM)=AFP/ic(hs)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/about-bong-joon-ho-profile-south-korea-director-12416638=" South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho has been on quite a wild ride this awards season. That trip reached its climax Sunday evening (Feb 9) – Monday (Feb 10) Singapore time – when he secured his country's first-ever Oscars for Parasite. The film, a vicious satire about the widening gap between rich and poor, took home Academy Awards for best original screenplay and best international feature after winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe and two Baftas. "We never write to represent our countries," said the 50-year-old Bong. "But this is (the) very first Oscar to South Korea. Thank you." Later, as he accepted the prize for best international feature, he said in English, eliciting laughs from the audience: "Yeah, I'm ready to drink tonight."   Bong - who is known for his dark and genre-hopping thrillers - already had a series of critical and commercial hits behind him before Parasite and is one of South Korea's best-known faces. This latest triumph on Hollywood's biggest night, a rarity for an Asian auteur filmmaker, should take him to new heights. "He's been an established director for close to 20 years and has made exceptional films," Jason Bechervaise, a professor at Korea Soongsil Cyber University, told AFP. "He's also very charming and sociable. This has been a factor, I think, in how far the film has gone - having done hundreds of interviews, possibly more, and mingling with voters and the Hollywood elite." ARTISTIC ELITE Bong grew up in an elite artistic family in Seoul - his maternal grandfather was a renowned novelist while his late father and all of his siblings are university professors in fields including fashion and fine art. He studied sociology at the South's prestigious Yonsei University and reportedly took part in street protests while enrolled there during the country's pro-democracy movement in the 1980s. Bong once told an interviewer he had been arrested for using petrol bombs. He was among the first wave of South Korean filmmakers to blossom after the country's full democratisation, which opened the door for a cultural renaissance. His Memories of Murder - a 2003 feature film based on real-life serial killings that rattled the nation in the 1980s - was seen as a metaphor for a repressive society under military rule. Bong's 2006 monster blockbuster The Host portrayed an incompetent government left helpless in the wake of a disaster. In 2014, parallels were drawn between the film and the Sewol ferry sinking that killed 300, mostly schoolchildren. His 2013 Snowpiercer depicted a dystopian future in which the last humans on Earth - who survived a failed attempt to stop global warming - travel endlessly on a train separated according to class, and the lower class revolts. Tilda Swinton, who was in Snowpiercer, also starred in Bong's Netflix-produced 2017 sci-fi action-adventure Okja about a country girl trying to save a genetically engineered beast from a greedy multinational firm. Quentin Tarantino - whose Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood was nominated for multiple Oscars this year - once likened the South Korean to "Steven Spielberg in his prime".   POLITICAL SUBTEXT Throughout his career, Bong has often tackled dark and difficult subjects including violent crime, systematic oppression and the climate crisis. He also has candidly spoken about dealing with severe anxiety, in a country where mental health has long been a taboo topic. "All his films are sociology-in-motion, and all his films have a political subtext," said Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. "They're all deeply inoculated with socially critical, political thought, without being preachy or obvious about it. Few other directors can do this.""
Snow problem for Japan's ice sculpture festival==AFP/ad=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/snow-problem-for-japan-s-ice-sculpture-festival-12416462=" SAPPORO, Japan: Every year, tens of thousands of tourists flock to the snow festival in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, attracted by some 200 large, but intricate ice sculptures. But this year, there's a problem: No snow. With high temperatures that festival-goers put down to climate change, organisers were forced to truck in powder from distant towns for their signature sculptures in an unheard-of ice crisis.   "This lack of snow is unprecedented," said Yumato Sato, an official in charge of organising the snow festival, which normally uses 30,000 tonnes of the stuff for sculptures ranging from anime characters to famous racehorses. "We had to bring in snow from places we had never reached out to before" such as Niseko, a town about 60km away from Sapporo famous for its skiing, he said. Adding to the problem was the need for pristine snow, perfect for sculpting. "The snow needs to be free of dirt, otherwise the sculptures can break up," he said. "We barely managed to scrape together enough snow." Record low snowfall in Japan this year has also forced many ski resorts to shut their pistes. According to Weathernews, one-quarter of the 400 resorts surveyed had been unable to operate. There has been a knock-on effect on one of the snow festival's main attractions - a 100m-long, 10m-high slide - that had to be reduced in size. 'ONCE BEFORE I DIE' Snowfall in Sapporo has been less than half the annual average, according to the Japan Meterological Agency's local observatory. High temperatures melted the snow in mid-December and the mercury is expected to stay above average. This posed a major challenge for the 125 local Self-Defense Forces troops who painstakingly construct the sculptures each year that can be as high as 15m, according to commanding officer Colonel Minoru Suzuki.   "Due to record warm weather this year, we didn't have much snow and the snow contained more water which made the statues melt easily," Suzuki told AFP. His troops spent about 100 days planning and building a 15m tall, 20m wide statue modelled on the palace at Lazienki Park in Warsaw to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese-Polish diplomatic relations in 2019. "We had to keep repairing the statue so we struggled. It was difficult to attach parts because it was so warm," he added. The festival has been running for 70 years and is a major tourist magnet, drawing 2.7 million visitors last year. Sunao Kinoshita, a 75-year-old who had travelled up from near Osaka, said he "had to see it once before I die".   "Northern Japanese cities have been hosting snow festivals every year. It would be a shame if such events ended" due to global warming, he said. A regular festival-goer from the region also laid the blame on global warming. "I was worried the climate was different this year," Ayaka Muto, 31, told AFP. "Usually we have more snow. I think it's strange. I feel global warming is happening," added Muto. 'SERIOUS AND A DISASTER' The main theme of this year's festival, which runs until Feb 11, is the ethnic Ainu minority in Hokkaido, as the first Ainu-themed national museum, nicknamed Upopoy or "singing together" in the Ainu language, will open in April. "We've never before had statues with such powerful Ainu characteristics," Sato said.   One statue featured a giant Blakiston's fish owl spreading its wings watching over sculptures of the museum and a ship. The owl is considered a god in Ainu culture. Another statue was based on the Ainu myth of a thunder god and a forest princess. And some have been turning to the nature gods of Japan's native Shinto religion to pray for more snow. In mid-January, a ski resort in western Hyogo prefecture invited a Shinto priest to hold a ceremony to ask the gods for snow, as did the organisers of the Yamagata snow festival in northern Japan. "It's not that we don't have enough snow. We don't have snow at all. It's serious and it's a disaster," Hyogo Governor Toshizo Ido told reporters last month. The Sapporo festival organisers hope they can continue the famed event in the future despite the warming climate. "This year marked the 71st event. It's a festival that we want to carry on for future generations," Sato said. "(But) this is about weather so all we can do is to pray.""

People in Singapore support use of clean energy, want 'more ambitious climate action': NCCS study=08 Feb 2020 02:41PM (Updated: 08 Feb 2020 03:39PM)=CNA/mt(cy)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/clean-energy-singapore-nccs-study-climate-change-12410492=" SINGAPORE: People in Singapore strongly support the use of clean energy to power homes, vehicles and industries, and want "more ambitious climate action", the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has found. These were among the findings from a public consultation exercise conducted by the NCCS which focused on Singapore’s long-term low emissions development strategy (LEDS). The exercise saw about 2,000 submissions from businesses, community groups, and individuals. It was held from Jul 16 to Sep 30 last year, and the findings released on Friday (Feb 7). Several stakeholder engagement sessions were also organised from August last year to January 2020 to facilitate discussions with youths, green groups, green councils, academics and businesses from a variety of sectors, said NCCS, which is part of the strategy group in the Prime Minister's Office. In general, the feedback received mirrored the results from a survey also conducted by the NCCS from May to July last year, that more Singaporeans are aware of climate change and are prepared to do more, it said. When it came to the use of clean energy, respondents indicated "strong support" of its use to power industries, vehicles and homes, said the NCCS. Solar energy was identified as the most viable clean energy source, with suggestions including the offering of incentives and rebates to encourage solar deployment on private and building rooftops. However, some also noted that issues like intermittency and Singapore's limited land area were "key limiting factors" in furthering deployment. There were also mixed responses when it came to the willingness to pay a premium for clean energy, said NCCS in a summary of its findings. Several respondents pointed out the higher costs of producing cleaner energy would increase the financial burden on lower-income households, while some said that the biggest emitters should bear the most responsibility to switch to renewable energy. In terms of climate action, some called for emissions to peak well before 2030, reach net-zero by 2050, and to be in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, said NCCS. However, respondents were also aware of the challenges involved in cutting down on emissions, noted NCCS. "Several noted that the technologies that will enable transformational shifts to a low carbon future are still in their infancy, while others cited economic competitiveness and employment concerns," it said. But as technologies develop, there remains the possibility to cut Singapore's emissions further. "We are carefully considering both the calls for climate ambition and the challenges involved in developing and implementing Singapore’s LEDS," said NCCS. "We agree that, as technologies develop or mature, there will be scope for greater reduction of our emissions." NCCS also said it recognised the concerns voiced by different stakeholders. "Addressing climate change requires a whole-of-society effort. The Government recognises the concerns from different stakeholders, and the significant effort necessary to transit to a low carbon future," said NCCS. "The Government will continue to study the suggestions, convene platforms for engagement, and explore partnerships with businesses, the community and individuals to develop solutions to build a resilient and sustainable Singapore.""
Global warming to blame for hottest day in Argentine Antarctica==AFP/nh=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/global-warming-to-blame-for-hottest-day-in-argentine-antarctica-12408768=" BUENOS AIRES: Global warming is to blame for Argentine Antarctica recording its hottest day since readings began, Greenpeace said on Friday (Feb 7). Temperatures climbed to 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit) at midday Thursday at the research station Esperanza base, the highest temperature on record since 1961, according to the National Meteorological Service. The previous record stood at 17.5 degrees on March 24, 2015. The new record is "of course shocking but unfortunately not surprising because Antarctica is warming up with the rest of the planet," said Frida Bengtsson, marine environment specialist for Greenpeace, in a statement. At Marambio, another Argentine base in Antarctica, temperatures reached 14.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the hottest temperature for a day in February since 1971. The news comes after a decade of record temperatures on the planet and a 2019 that was the second hottest year since registers have been kept. And the new decade has begun along the same tendency, with last month the hottest January on record. The effects of global warming have already seen ocean levels rise due to melting ice caps. The two largest ice caps on the planet, in Antarctica and Greenland, have already lost an average of a combined 430 billion tons a year since 2006. According to UN climate experts, the oceans rose 15 centimeters during the 20th century. It's a threat to coastal towns and small islands the world over. One of the largest glaciers in Antarctica is the Thwaites glacier, which is the size of Britain. Scientists say that if it melted it would raise sea levels by 65 centimeters. "Over the last 30 years, the amount of ice melting off Thwaites and adjacent glaciers has nearly doubled," said the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration group of scientists in a statement. Argentina has had a presence in Antarctica for the past 114 years, including several scientific research bases, and is also a signatory of the Antarctic Treaty, which came into force in June 1961 and prohibits any militarization of the continent."
Antarctic base records hottest temperature ever=07 Feb 2020 11:42PM=Reuters/nh=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/antarctic-base-records-hottest-temperature-ever-12407530=" GENEVA/BUENOS AIRES: A research base in the Antarctic has recorded the hottest temperature ever for the continent amid rising concern about global warming that has caused an increase in the melting of ice sheets around the south pole. The Esperanza base on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula recorded a temperature of 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.94 degrees Fahrenheit), the highest on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday. "(This) is not a figure you would normally associate with Antarctica even in the summertime. This beat the former record of 17.5 degrees C, which was set back in 2015," WMO spokeswoman Clare Nullis told reporters in Geneva. "The Antarctic peninsula ... is among the fastest warming regions of the planet. We hear a lot about the Arctic, but this particular part of the Antarctic peninsula is warming very quickly." The temperature was recorded at the Argentine base on Thursday. Scientists believe global warming has caused so much melting at the south pole that the giant ice sheet is now on course to disintegrate. This would see an eventual global sea level rise of at least three meters (10 feet) over centuries. A WMO committee will verify whether the temperature logged by Argentina's national meteorological service is a new record for the Antarctic continent. The record in the wider Antarctic region is 19.8 degrees C in January 1982. "The amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017," Nullis added, citing images showing cracks in glaciers in Antarctica. "The melting from these glaciers, you know, means we are in big trouble when it comes to sea level rise.""
Joker's Joaquin Phoenix takes aim at climate apathy with film about dying Earth=07 Feb 2020 12:00AM (Updated: 07 Feb 2020 07:41AM)=Reuters/sr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/joker-joaquin-phoenix-climate-change-film-guardians-of-life-12402380=" Oscar favourite Joaquin Phoenix stars as a medic battling to save a dying planet Earth in a film launched on Thursday (Feb 6), the first in a series of short Hollywood productions aimed at spurring action on climate change. The Joker star teamed up with environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch, a California-based organisation campaigning to protect the Amazon rainforest, to produce the two-minute film Guardians Of Life. Shot in a Los Angeles emergency room, the movie shows doctors attempting to save an unidentified patient whose flatlining vital signs represent the threat posed by climate change, deforestation and fires from Australia to the Amazon. "It's really a call to action," said Phoenix, among the most prominent Hollywood stars to draw attention to the catastrophic damage being caused by human-induced global warming. "People don't realise there's still time, but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We can't wait for governments to solve these problems for us." Founded in Britain, Extinction Rebellion promotes its climate activism through civil disobedience, and Phoenix was himself arrested at a climate change protest organised by fellow Hollywood star Jane Fonda in Washington last month, a few days after winning a Golden Globe for his starring role in Joker. The first in a planned series of 12 short films, Guardians Of Life points to the vital role indigenous people play in protecting habitats, a finding emphasised by scientists studying the million plant and animal species they say risk extinction due to damage caused by industrial society. "This film is very important for us at this moment," said Sonia Guajajara, head of Brazil's largest indigenous umbrella organisation, the Association of Indigenous Peoples. "It demonstrates the artists' engagement in Amazon protection by showing the key role indigenous peoples play in defending the forests, the planet, and life itself." Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine and Oona Chaplin appear alongside Phoenix in the film. It was directed by Shaun Monson and produced with Mobilize Earth, a US not-for-profit organisation set up for the series, and aims to raise money for Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch. "There is still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen," said Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion. "But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real." (Source: Reuters)"
Motor Rally - Lack of snow forces Rally Sweden to shorten course for WRC event=05 Feb 2020 08:20PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/motor-rally---lack-of-snow-forces-rally-sweden-to-shorten-course-for-wrc-event-12398046=" STOCKHOLM: The Swedish round of the world rally championship will go ahead on Feb. 13 over a shortened course due to an unusually mild winter and a lack of snow, organizers Rally Sweden said on Wednesday. Amid worries about global warming, temperatures in parts of Sweden have been up to 10 degrees Celsius over the normal average for January, according to the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, and little snow has fallen except in the far north. On Tuesday, the sport's governing body the FIA inspected the proposed course for Rally Sweden, which takes place in the Varmland region and across the border in Norway during its four day schedule, with the organizers deciding to leave out certain sections. "The new timetable will feature about 180km of spectacular speed tests and full championship points will be awarded," the organizers said in a statement. Last year's rally, won by Estonia's Ott Tanak, covered around 315 kilometres. The rally was cancelled in 1990 and shortened in 2016, on both occasions due to mild weather. Previous winners include rally legends such as Sweden's Stig Blomqvist, Finns Hannu Mikkola and Juha Kankkunen, and Frenchman Sebastien Loeb.

Electric future: Britain to ban new petrol and hybrid cars from 2035==Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/electric-future--britain-to-ban-new-petrol-and-hybrid-cars-from-2035-12390628=" LONDON: Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26. "We have to deal with our CO2 emissions, and that is why the UK is calling for us to get to net zero as soon as possible, to get every country to announce credible targets to get there – that’s what we want from Glasgow," Johnson said on Tuesday at a launch event for COP26 at London's Science Museum, alongside broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. "We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act." The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming with responsibility for persuading big polluting countries to agree more ambitious emissions cuts falling on the British hosts. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050, but Greenpeace UK Head of Politics Rebecca Newsom said Johnson needed to take broader action than cleaning up transport. "We need a complete rethink of the way we power our economy, build homes, move around and grow our food," she said. Britain's step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself. Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040 and Norway's parliament has set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars should be zero emissions. ELECTRIC VEHICLES While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail. The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest global export market for its car manufacturers, amounting to about 20per cent of global sales, and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants. The government said that, subject to consultation, it planned to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible. Diesel and petrol models still account for 90per cent of sales in Britain, and prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost. The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds (US$3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1,000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets. It has also provided investment for the development of electric vehicle technology. Johnson's launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit's former head Clare O'Neill who was sacked from the post last week. Johnson declined to answer any questions on O'Neill, but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister. A government source suggested her replacement would most likely to announced in a wider reshuffle of government posts expected this month. O'Neill, a former energy minister, accused Johnson of a lack of leadership and said he had admitted to her he did not understand climate change. "My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises - whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed family members - is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it, and make sure the money is in the bank," she told BBC radio.

Reports of landlords evicting people on home quarantine or leave of absence 'troubling': Iswaran===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-landlords-evicting-quarantine-troubling-12375140=" SINGAPORE: Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said on Friday (Jan 31) that the Government has heard "troubling or disturbing stories" of landlords who are evicting people serving their home quarantine or taking leave of absence, as Singapore ramps up on precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus here. "This is not the kind of response we need," said Mr Iswaran in a press conference, which was also attended by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority commissioner Marvin Sim. "We are all in this together. Those on quarantine or leave of absence are subject to this for the sake of the wider community so that the rest of us do not run the risk of infection. "We do not know how this situation will evolve and there may be other cases that need similar action. It is an overall national effort," said Mr Iswaran. Earlier on Friday, the World Health Organization had declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. "This means the global community now has an even greater impetus to work together to contain the virus and then to eradicate the threat," said Mr Iswaran. He cited the widened travel restrictions announced by Mr Wong during the press conference, which blocks entry for new visitors with recent travel history to China, including Chinese passport holders who are not Singapore permanent residents or long-term pass holders. Singapore residents returning from China will have to take a 14-day leave of absence. The Ministry of Education said on Friday morning that nearly 1,000 students and staff are currently on leave of absence after returning from China. Other measures include the nationwide mask distribution, which starts on Saturday, as well as the use of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) legislations to tackle the spread of false information. With all these measures, "there will be some disruptions to our daily lives", said Mr Iswaran, calling on the "understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans". He praised the efforts of Singaporeans who have been buying food and running errands for their neighbours who are under quarantine. “These are heart-warming efforts, and it speaks loudly of the big heart and resilient spirit of Singaporeans,” he said. “That is the spirit that we need and we want to stand together to defeat the virus and the challenge it poses. We have done it before, as with SARS, and we can do it again.” NO COMMUNITY SPREAD IN SINGAPORE There remains no community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of Friday evening. Three new cases were confirmed by MOH, one of whom was a Singaporean who was evacuated from Wuhan earlier in the week. The 13 previously confirmed cases are in stable condition and making "good clinical progress", said Mr Mak. None of them are critically ill, he added. Fifteen of the total confirmed cases are Chinese nationals who had travelled to the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. “To date, there’s no evidence of any local spread to any Singapore resident in Singapore and we remain watchful and vigilant to make sure that this continues to be so. Contact tracing for contacts of our local cases continues, and it is still underway," he said. Asked about the possibility of cancelling events such as the Singapore Air Show over virus fears, Mr Wong said scheduled events will proceed as planned but precautions will be taken. Some attendees may be prevented from showing up due to the travel restrictions, but there are no plans to cancel the Air Show at this stage, he added.

Commentary: When it comes to climate change, Japan’s leaders need to walk the talk===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/is-japan-delivering-on-climate-change-nuclear-oil-fossil-fuels-12311532=" TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly pledged that his country would lead global efforts to address climate change. Increasingly, however, Japan is facing scrutiny over the gap between its lofty rhetoric and the reality of its climate policies, which include on-going support for coal-fired power, and inadequate emission reduction targets. Shinjiro Koizumi, the environment minister, mounted only a half-hearted defence of Japan’s policy mix when he told the COP25 climate summit in Madrid last month that he was aware of global criticism and added: A growing number of people in Japan, including myself, believe further climate actions must be taken. The calls – from inside and outside government – for more ambitious policy moves come at a critical time. This year, Japan, like other Paris Agreement signatories, will be urged to review and ideally increase its emission pledges ahead of the November climate conference in Glasgow. MORE CUTS NEEDED So how, exactly, is Japan falling short? For starters, analysts say its near-term target isn’t consistent with the scale of cuts required to prevent more damaging climate impacts. Japan is pledging to reduce emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 compared with 2013 levels – a baseline year in which fossil fuel use had spiked, in part because the country’s nuclear reactors went offline after the 2011 Fukushima meltdowns. The website Climate Action Tracker, made up of a consortium of climate research institutes and consultants, rates the target as “highly insufficient”, noting that it is actually closer to 23 per cent once credits for land use and forestry measures are excluded, while warning “if all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming could reach over 3 degrees Celsius and up to 4 degrees Celsius.” The globe has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, Japan and other signatories committed to holding the global temperature rise this century to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and “to pursue efforts” to limit it to just 1.5 degrees Celsius.   While 1.5 degrees of warming will increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth, these risks will grow even further with 2 degrees Celsius of warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC notes that globally, carbon dioxide emissions must decline by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In other words, the coming decade is vital. WALK THE TALK If Japan wants to lead global efforts, as Abe claims, it could consider adopting a more ambitious near-term target to help gain the credibility needed to encourage other major emitters to act. At the moment, however, Japan’s plans for its energy sector this decade continue to place a significant emphasis on fossil fuels while embracing a gradual shift to renewables. Coal, LNG and oil are still projected to account for a combined 56 per cent of Japan’s energy mix in 2030, confirming Japan’s on-going status as a major export market for Australian coal and gas. Renewables, meanwhile, are pegged at about 22 per cent to 24 per cent in 2030 – a goal that Taro Kono, the defence minister, has previously criticised as lamentably low. Nuclear power is earmarked to supply 20 per cent to 22 per cent of the energy mix at the end of the decade, even though the reopening of reactors has been slowed by tighter regulatory checks and legal challenges post-Fukushima. COAL TREATMENT While several coal-fired power station projects have been cancelled over the last couple of years, units with capacity totalling 13 gigawatts are either planned or already under construction across the country, according to the Japan Coal Plant Tracker.   Japan is also financing or providing other support for coal-fired power station projects abroad, via public entities such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Koizumi was reported by Japanese media to have pushed for tighter curbs on coal power plant exports in the lead-up to the climate conference last month but was blocked amid resistance from the industry ministry. He alluded to his disappointment when he informed COP25 delegates that he was afraid he was unable to share any new developments regarding coal policy. In the longer term, Japan is pledging to achieve net zero emissions “as early as possible in the second half of this century”, a vague timeframe that leaves plenty of wiggle room for delayed transformation across what is the world’s third-largest economy. Again, the IPCC has indicated that the 1.5-degrees Celsius warming limit could be out of reach unless global carbon dioxide emissions fall to net zero by around 2050. Japan’s strategy looks tentative compared with those of the United Kingdom, which passed a law last year requiring it to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, and the European Union, which also is aiming for mid-century. Japan’s long-term strategy highlights the country’s potential strengths as it moves to decarbonise the economy and emphasises the need for “disruptive innovation”. With a significant automotive industry, for example, Japan can win from the rising use of electric vehicles, and Japan is also eyeing opportunities from hydrogen – a potential area of cooperation with Australia. But all of this needs to be underpinned by decisive political leadership to build momentum in international climate negotiations. Abe says he wants to lead. This year, he has a chance to prove it.

US Treasury Secretary advises Greta Thunberg to 'go study'==AFP/hs/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/steven-mnuchin-to-greta-thunberg-go-study-world-economic-forum-12312748=" DAVOS: The United States' financial chief on Thursday (Jan 23) told Swedish teen Greta Thunberg to go study before calling for a fossil fuel halt, prompting the climate campaigner to reply it doesn't "take a degree" to understand the science. The spat between US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Thunberg again highlighted the tensions over climate change at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where governments have come under pressure to act on global warming as well as talk about the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday also said in a keynote address that governments were obliged to act on the younger generation's concerns over climate change. Mnuchin had earlier advised Thunberg, who has been bitterly critical of US policy during her stay at Davos, to study economics before giving out lessons. Asked about the 17-year-old's demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels, he told reporters: "After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us." But in a thread of tweets, Thunberg dismissed Mnuchin's comments in a typically withering response. "My gap year ends in August, but it doesn't take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5 degrees carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don't add up," she wrote. "So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments," she added. In her speech to the forum, Merkel said that older politicians had to use the "positive manner and constructive impatience of young people", who she said "have a completely different horizon" in terms of time. She did not however in her speech mention Thunberg, who other than Britain's Prince Charles has met relatively few top leaders at the forum. 'WE WANT THIS DONE NOW' In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump had castigated the "prophets of doom" and those that predicted a climate "apocalypse", in comments widely seen as an attack on Thunberg who sat in the audience. But either by accident or design, there was no meeting between Trump and Thunberg before the US leader left the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday declaring he would have "loved" to have met the climate activist, Time magazine's Person of the Year. Thunberg at the forum had repeated her climate warnings in sometimes withering terms, hammering home in a speech that it was time to "panic" because "the house is burning". Notably she had called for an immediate halt to investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and an end to fossil fuel subsidies "We don't want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now," she said. Thunberg is to hold a "school strike" demonstration in Davos on Friday. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told AFP during the forum that governments were still failing to act on climate change. Attending the summit was like being at a "crime scene where all of the criminals are right there in front of you," she said. "But these are the targets. These are the people who have to change.""
Warren calls on big US banks to disclose preparation for climate risk=23 Jan 2020 12:00AM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/warren-calls-on-big-us-banks-to-disclose-preparation-for-climate-12304564=" SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, is asking the biggest US banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming. "To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks," Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. "I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution's practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks," she said in the letters, provided to Reuters. She asked for detailed written responses by Feb 7. Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action. The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world's largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming. Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account. At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the US Federal Reserve signalled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system. But overall, US financial regulators lag their peers abroad. The current Republican US administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. STRESS TESTS On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken centre stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as "perennial prophets of doom." Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party’s nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for US president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow US Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls. All three are in favour of more government action to reduce US carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the US economy. Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to "stress test" banks' resilience to climate-related financial risks. In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law. She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response. "As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank's adaptation and mitigation strategies," Warren wrote. Many large US banks, including those receiving Warren's letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board. Reuters asked each bank for comment on Warren's letter after normal business hours. A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education."
Trump 'would have loved' to have met Thunberg at Davos==AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-would-have-loved-to-have-met-thunberg-at-davos-12303848=" DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday (Jan 22) he would have loved to have met Swedish environment activist Greta Thunberg at Davos but added that she should not focus her anger on the United States. "I would have loved to have seen her," Trump told reporters before leaving the luxury Swiss resort, while claiming that countries other than the United States were the worst polluters and "Greta ought to focus on those places". Trump had launched an extraordinary attack on environmental campaigners in a speech to the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Tuesday, saying they were "perennial prophets of doom" and the "heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers". Thunberg sat quietly through the speech and was unrepentant in later remarks. "Our house is still on fire," she said. Trump denied he thought global warming was a hoax, saying: "No not at all - I think aspects of it are." He said campaigners had put global warming "at a level that is unrealistic" to the point where people cannot live their lives. Also speaking at Davos, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the administration's policies, saying its views had been misinterpreted. "The US administration believes in clean air and clean water. This is a very complicated issue. We support a clean environment we just think it can be done in a way that is pro-business," he said."
Trump rejects environmental 'prophets of doom' at Davos forum=21 Jan 2020 08:29PM (Updated: 21 Jan 2020 10:53PM)=AFP/Reuters/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-rejects-environment-prophets-of-doom-greta-thunberg-davos-12296992=" DAVOS, Switzerland: US President Donald Trump took aim on Tuesday (Jan 21) at the "perennial prophets of doom" on the environment, telling the annual Davos forum that warnings of climate crisis were "foolish". In a keynote speech to the 50th World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, Trump touted fossil fuels, deregulation and a booming US economy - a message in stark contrast to the dire warnings delivered by teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg and others.  "We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse," Trump said hours after Thunberg told the World Economic Forum that governments had done "basically nothing" to reverse climate change. With Thunberg in the audience, Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters "the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers". As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down.   Trump ticked off what he said were previous predictions that had been proved wrong, ranging from over-population in the 1960s to "an end of oil" in the 1990s. "We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy," said Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November. Trump took the stage in Davos just after the Swiss president delivered a speech appealing for the world to care for the planet. But the US leader heralded the United States as "number one producer of oil and natural gas". He rattled off numbers indicating what he said were huge savings for American consumers and invited Europe to buy more US energy products. The expansion of oil, gas and coal production has "been so successful that the United States no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations", he said. "Our European allies no longer have to be vulnerable" if they "use America's vast supply". Trump said the United States was joining a newly announced international initiative called the "one trillion trees" project and he said he wanted to conserve "the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world." "I'm a very big believer in the environment. I want the cleanest water and the cleanest air," he added. But he said technical innovation, not restricting economic growth, is the way forward. "Fear and doubt is not a good thought process," he said. Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz said the strongest thing about Trump's speech was that it was scheduled between sessions on climate change. He criticised the President's swipe at climate 'pessimists'. "As if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there," Stiglitz said. "It's astounding." In Washington, the impeachment trial begins in earnest in the US Senate after the Republican president was formally charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December with "high crimes and misdemeanours". Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges."
Davos financiers pump US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels: Greenpeace===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/davos-financiers-pump-us-1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels-12296738="  PARIS: Some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested US$1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal, Greenpeace said on Tuesday (Jan 21) at the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. With the climate emergency expected to be front and centre at the annual summit of the world's business elite, the charity accused some institutions in attendance of failing to live up to the Forum's goal of "improving the state of the world". Greenpeace analysed the portfolios of 24 of the banks represented at Davos and found that they had financed the fossil fuel industry to the tune of US$1.4 trillion since the landmark 2015 Paris deal. That accord enjoins nations to limit global temperature rises to "well below" two degrees Celsius through a rapid and wide-ranging drawdown of planet-warming carbon emissions. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on the subject - says that for a better-than-even chance of reaching the safer Paris cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius, oil and gas consumption would need to decline 37 per cent and 25 per cent respectively by 2030. The IPCC says coal use must fall two thirds by 2030 and fall to virtually zero by mid-century to keep Earth on a 1.5-Celsius path. Yet carbon emissions are growing every year as global energy demand surges, and the International Energy Association said Monday that fossil fuel companies are still only investing 0.8 per cent of their spending in renewables. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said financial institutions were complicit in climate change by funding the fuels that drive it. "Banks, insurers and pension funds are as culpable for the climate emergency as the fossil fuel industry - specifically those that go to Davos," Morgan told AFP. "These Davos players say they support the Paris agreement but since its signing they've pumped US$1.4 trillion into fossil fuels." 'PROPPING UP DIRTY ENERGY' The Greenpeace report found that just 10 banks had provided US$1 trillion to fossil fuels since Paris. That same amount could pay to double the world's solar power capacity. It also identified three pension funds with at least US$26 billion in fossil fuel holdings, and alleged that four of the world's biggest insurance firms - AIG, Prudential, Sompo and Tokio marine - had no publicly disclosed policies to divest from fossil fuels. "The fossil fuel industry needs the finance sector but its not the same the other way around, so why are these bank, insurers and pensions propping up dirty energy?" asked Morgan, who will be participating in the four-day Davos forum. Last year green groups issued the Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card, identifying a rise in funding for coal, oil and gas each year since Paris was signed. "The massive scale at which global banks continue to pump billions of dollars into fossil fuels is flatly incompatible with a liveable future," said Alison Kirsh, climate and energy lead researcher at Rainforest Action Network."
Thunberg, Trump offer competing visions at climate-focused Davos==AFP/nc/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/thunberg-trump-offer-competing-visions-at-climate-focused-davos-12294892=" DAVOS, Switzerland: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jan 21) assailed environmental "prophets of doom", delivering an uncompromising message in Davos after Swedish teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg slammed government inaction on the climate crisis. Thunberg was in the audience in the Swiss Alps to hear a typically bullish speech by Trump, delivered just before the start of his Senate impeachment trial in Washington. The 50th meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) got under way in the ski resort with an avowed focus on climate change but with starkly different visions over global warming laid bare. "We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse," said Trump, growling that "they want to see us do badly". He claimed that "alarmists" had been wrong on previous occasions by predicting population crisis, mass starvation and the end of oil. Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters "the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers". Trump told reporters later that his Davos trip was devoted to meeting "the most important people in the world and we're bringing back tremendous business". "The other's just a hoax," he said of the "disgraceful" impeachment trial. 'NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE' Before Trump's appearance, Thunberg underlined the message that has inspired millions around the world, saying "basically nothing has been done" to fight climate change. "It will require much more than this. This is just the very beginning," the 17-year-old said. Speaking calmly and with a wry smile, Thunberg acknowledged that her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving concrete change. "There is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something," she said. While the WEF and individual business leaders have been detailing their own concerns about climate change, Greenpeace complained in a new report that some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested US$1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal in 2016. Trump in his speech reeled off a list of achievements for the American economy and touted the United States as the "number one producer of oil and natural gas". DAVOS SHOWDOWN? There are no expectations that Trump and Thunberg, who have exchanged barbs through Twitter, would actually meet, but the crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out. When Trump and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last year at the annual General Assembly, a photo of the teenager staring in apparent fury at the president from the sidelines went viral. Although Trump's Republican party holds a majority in the Senate and is almost sure to acquit him on charges of abusing his power and obstructing Congress, the impeachment adds volatility to an already tense 2020 presidential election. "We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy," said Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November. 'GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO FAIL' Sustainability is the buzzword at the Davos forum, which began in 1971, with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on the icy streets rather than use cars, and the signage paint made out of seaweed. Trump's opposition to renewable energy, his withdrawal from the Paris accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and the free hand extended to the fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with the thrust of this year's event. "People are paying a lot more attention" to climate, Eurasia Group president Ian Bremner told AFP at Davos, adding there was "genuine action by some big players", after investment titan BlackRock said it was partially divesting out of coal. "But let's be clear - a big part of this is because we failed for a very long time and governments continue to fail," he added. Business leaders are likely also to be concerned by the state of the global economy whose prospects, according to the International Monetary Fund, have improved but remain brittle. The IMF cut its global growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 per cent, saying that a recent truce in the trade war between China and the US had brought some stability but that risks remained. Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete action to fight inequality, after Oxfam issued a report outlining how the number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the world's 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa."
UK puts visas into pitch for post-Brexit trade with Africa=21 Jan 2020 06:51AM=AFP/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/brexit-uk-africa-trade-boris-johnson-visas-12293880=" LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson told African leaders Monday (Jan 20) that Britain would be more open to migrants from their continent after Brexit as he hosted a summit intended to boost trading ties. He also promised an end to direct UK state investment in thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas, saying London would focus on supporting a switch to low-carbon energy sources. Opening the first UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, Johnson made a clear pitch for business less than two weeks before Britain leaves the European Union. He told the conference involving 16 national leaders and representatives of another five countries, he wanted to make Britain their "investment partner of choice". After highlighting all Britain has to offer, he said Brexit would mean an end to preferential treatment for EU migrants. "Our (immigration) system is becoming fairer and more equal between all our global friends and partners, treating people the same, wherever they come from," he said. "By putting people before passports we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be." Johnson met with the presidents of Nigeria, Rwanda, Ghana and Uganda at the summit, and was due to hold talks with the leaders of Egypt and Kenya on Tuesday. Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari said Brexit offered an opportunity for increased free trade across the Commonwealth - and highlighted visas as a key issue. "While many in the African diaspora enjoy considerable benefits from life in the West, they do not always feel at the heart of the community," he wrote in The Times newspaper on Monday. "A renewed sense that there are ties that bind us through the Commonwealth, and a concerted effort to grow those links through trade, could act as a spur to encourage togetherness and the certainty of belonging." BREATHE THE SAME AIR The prime minister also announced a shift in investment strategy to help combat global warming, ahead of Glasgow staging the next UN climate change summit later this year. "There's no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn, if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it, is there?" he said. "We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky. We all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms." He added: "Not another penny of UK taxpayers money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. "Instead, we're going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives." Campaign group Greenpeace UK welcomed the announcement, although it said Britain could do more. "It's great that in the middle of a climate emergency the UK government is finally putting a stop to taxpayers' money being used to support coal plants and mines abroad," executive director John Sauven said. "But if Britain wants to lead by example, it should also urgently phase out support for oil and gas developments, which are pushing the world closer to climate chaos." Sub-Saharan African faces a number of environmental challenges, particularly the effects of climate change, water and air pollution, desertification, deforestation and over-fishing. INCREASE "RISK APPETITE" The government's export agency reports providing £2 billion (US$2.6 billion) in financing for British company exports to Africa in the past two years. The agency says it now wants to "increase its risk appetite" in Egypt and the emerging economies in Nigeria and Rwanda. British and African firms announced 27 commercial deals worth £6.5 billion at the summit, from energy provision in Cote D'Ivoire to road projects in Ghana and breweries in Kenya. Britain will leave the EU on Jan 31, although ties will remain the same for 11 months while the two sides thrash out a new trading relationship. London wants to leave the bloc's single market and customs union to allow it to strike trade deals with other countries, even if this brings new barriers to EU trade."
Climate change pushes investors to take their temperature=20 Jan 2020 03:10PM (Updated: 20 Jan 2020 06:00PM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/climate-change-pushes-investors-to-take-their-temperature-12289500=" LONDON: Move over revenue growth and dividend payouts: it's time to take your portfolio's temperature. Policymakers are pushing investors to do more to ensure their portfolio choices help to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change by limiting planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5C. A vanguard of insurers and pension funds, many of whom will be in Davos this week for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, say part of the answer is a new "temperature score" that gives a snapshot of how their investments are contributing to climate change. A single score, they say, can help them navigate the reallocation of capital from heavily polluting sectors of the global economy likely to take a financial hit to greener companies poised to profit. So far, the temperature metric has been adopted by only a handful of the thousands of financial institutions worldwide but the buzz it has generated shows how investors' concerns about climate risk are finally moving into the mainstream. "There's still a massive amount of work to be done on this but it's very encouraging that we as an industry are being forced to answer this temperature score question," said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas Asset Management. "If you thought you could ignore climate change before, you just can't anymore." France is leading the way with 18 firms, including insurer AXA and reinsurer Scor, disclosing the temperature score of all or part of their portfolios in 2018. British regulators have flagged that they could require some banks and insurers to report temperature scores from 2021 in annual portfolio stress tests. Asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen, German reinsurer Munich Re, Swiss rival Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance all told Reuters they were considering assigning temperature scores to their portfolios. INCREMENTAL INDICATOR Temperature scores are one of several investor-led initiatives to spring up in the last few years as policymakers crank up the pressure on the financial industry to accelerate change. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European body of mainly pension funds and asset managers with 30 trillion euros (US$33 trillion) of combined assets under management, launched an initiative in May to work out how members can use their financial clout to back the Paris goals. That was followed by the launch of the "Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance" at a U.N. climate summit in September. The group, which has so far signed up 16 insurers and pension funds with combined assets of almost US$4 trillion, has pledged to align investments with the most ambitious Paris temperature targets. The world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, last week announced an overhaul of the way it approaches climate risk. Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the "strongest foundation" for client portfolios. Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with US$25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development. "This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition," David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters. TRICKY CALCULATION Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number. Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager Schroders, said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be "robust and logical". "There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work," he said. Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their "carbon intensity" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue. A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time. Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C. "The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like," said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores. The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers. Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer. "A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits," said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI. "You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future." STRANDED ASSETS Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years. The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory. Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy. Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities. Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as "warming potentials" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions. "Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero," said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month. The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz British rival Aviva and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C. AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C. "The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?" he said. "We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down."

'We can't wait': Maldives desperate for funds as islands risk going under=17 Jan 2020 05:26PM (Updated: 17 Jan 2020 05:31PM)=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/maldives-sinking-underwater-wall-funds-climate-change-12274266=" NEW DELHI: The tropical Maldives may lose entire islands unless it can quickly access cheap financing to fight the impact of climate change, its foreign minister said. The archipelago's former president Mohamed Nasheed famously held a cabinet meeting underwater to draw attention to submerging land and global warming a decade ago. Yet the Maldives, best known for its white sands and palm-fringed atolls that draw luxury holiday-makers, has struggled to find money to build critical infrastructure like sea-walls. "For small states, it is not easy," Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid told Reuters in New Delhi. "By the time the financing is obtained, we may be underwater." At the UN climate talks in Madrid in December, the Maldives and other vulnerable countries pushed for concrete progress on fresh funding to help them deal with disasters and longer-term damage linked to climate change - but failed. Shahid was hopeful the next round of talks, slated to take place in Glasgow in November, would yield better results. One of the world's lowest-lying countries, more than 80 per cent of the Maldives' land is less than one metre above mean sea levels, making its population of around 530,000 people extremely vulnerable to storm surges, sea swells and severe weather. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami ravaged the Muslim-majority state, causing financial losses of around US$470 million - 62 per cent of GDP - and hitting infrastructure, including its only international airport that was shut for several days. 'WE NEED IT' Two of the country's main industries - tourism and fishing - are heavily dependent on coastal resources, and most settlements and critical infrastructure is concentrated along the coast. In 2014, more than 100 of the archipelago's inhabited islands were already reporting erosion, and around 30 islands are identified as severely eroded. The Maldives spends around US$10 million annually for coastal protection works, but will need up to US$8.8 billion in total to shield all of its inhabited islands, according to a 2016 estimate by its environment ministry. "In order to protect the islands, we need to start building sea walls," Shahid said. "It's expensive, but we need it. We can't wait until all of them are being taken away." The United Nations has created a pot to help developing nations, called the Green Climate Fund, which has already approved nearly US$24 million in funding to the Maldives, according to its website. Some individual nations have also offered help, including Japan which contributed to a sea wall round the Maldives' capital Male. Shahid did not specify where his government was pushing for more funding. However, Environment Minister Hussain Rasheed Hassan said recently his country would have to turn to banks given inadequate funding elsewhere despite the fact small nations like his were paying the price for the developed world's pollution. "We have to beg some of these (big) emitters to provide money for us. Is that fair?" he said."
2019 was Singapore’s joint warmest year on record, equalling 2016 temperatures: Met Service=16 Jan 2020 12:00PM (Updated: 16 Jan 2020 11:07PM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/2019-was-singapore-s-joint-warmest-year-on-record-equalling-2016-12267536=" SINGAPORE: Last year was Singapore’s joint warmest year, with an annual mean temperature of 28.4 degrees Celsius, the Meteorological Service (MSS) said on Thursday (Jan 16). That is the same as the annual mean temperature in 2016 and 0.9 degrees Celsius higher than the 1981 to 2010 long-term average.   Last year was also “particularly dry”, with “below average annual total rainfall” at most places across the island, making it the third driest year ever recorded since 1869 when rainfall records began, said MSS. For example, 1368mm of rainfall was recorded at Changi climate station, 37 per cent below the 1981 to 2010 long-term average. At 27.94 degrees Celsius, the mean temperature for 2010 to 2019 surpassed the previous warmest decade from 2009 to 2018, said MSS in a media release. Temperature records started in 1929. Above-average temperatures were also recorded in all months of 2019, with August and September breaking records for those months. Contributing to 2019’s higher temperatures was the development of one of the strongest, positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events since the 1960s, which “contributed significantly” to the below-average rainfall and higher temperatures observed, especially during the third quarter, said MSS. A positive IOD typically contributes to drier and warmer conditions over Singapore from June to September. MSS said that these temperature trends are “in general agreement” with the latest World Meteorological Organization Statement on the State of the Global Climate, which confirmed that 2019 was the second warmest year on record globally."
China to make national carbon trading 'breakthrough' by year-end: Official=14 Jan 2020 12:04PM=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-carbon-emissions-trading-scheme-12261042=" BEIJING: China expects to make a "breakthrough" on the establishment of a nationwide carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS) by the end of this year, the country's senior climate change official told Reuters on Tuesday (Jan 14). Establishing a nationwide ETS was one of the pledges made by China ahead of the Paris climate change agreement of 2015, but implementation has been repeatedly delayed amid concerns about transparency and the quality of the nation's emissions data. "We will strive to make a breakthrough in progress before the year-end," said Li Gao, head of the climate office at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Beijing. The scheme was originally designed to include all major industrial sectors but its first phase will be limited to the coal-fired power industry, which is responsible for around 3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. China's total annual carbon emissions stand at around 12.3 billion tonnes, according to the last full inventory covering the year 2014. Beijing has already ordered firms from eight industrial sectors - oil, chemicals, construction materials, steel, nonferrous metals, papermaking, electric power and shipping - to submit their carbon emission data before the end of March, in preparation for the ETS launch. China, the world's biggest producer of climate-warming greenhouse gases, is under pressure to deliver new and more ambitious pledges to cut emissions as part of its commitments to the Paris agreement. It aims to bring its emissions to a peak by "around 2030", but environmental groups are calling on the government to reach the target earlier, and to make radical new commitments to cut coal consumption in its 2021-2025 five-year plan. Senior officials, however, have been seeking to curb expectations. Li Ganjie, Minister of Ecology and Environment, told a national meeting on Monday that the situation facing China's environment remained "grim" amid "profound and complex changes" affecting the global economy. Economic growth in China has slowed to its slowest in nearly three decades following a punishing trade war with the United States, sparking concerns that China's campaign to cut pollution and decarbonise could be relaxed."
Australia's massive fires could become routine, climate scientists warn==Reuters/aa=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-fires-could-become-routine-climate-change-scientists-12260900=" LONDON: Bushfires ravaging Australia have provided a foretaste of the kinds of conditions that could become normal unless the world moves rapidly to curb emissions of the greenhouse gases driving global warming, scientists have warned. Although Australia's government and parts of its media have attempted to downplay the role of man-made climate change in making the country more vulnerable to wildfires, a review of 57 scientific papers published since 2013 suggested clear links. "We're not going to reverse climate change on any conceivable timescale. So the conditions that are happening now, they won't go away," Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts Research at Britain's Met Office Hadley Centre, who co-authored the review, told a news conference in London on Monday (Jan 13). The review found that climate change had led to an increase in the frequency and severity of what scientists call "fire weather" - periods with a high fire risk due to some combination of hotter temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and strong winds. The effects had not only been observed in Australia, but from the western United States and Canada, to southern Europe, Scandinavia, the Amazon and Siberia, the review found.   Globally, fire weather seasons have lengthened across about 25 per cent of the Earth's vegetated surface, resulting in about a 20 per cent increase in the mean length of the fire weather season, according to observational data. Betts said Australia was particularly vulnerable to fires since its land area had warmed by more than the rise in average global temperature of about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. The World Meteorological Organization says the global temperature increase could hit 3-5 degrees Celsius this century - more than three times limits agreed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement - if nothing is done to stop rising emissions. "Temperature conditions in Australia are extreme at the moment but they are what we expect to happen on average in a world of three degrees of global warming," Betts said. "It brings it home to you what climate change means." The review was carried out using ScienceBrief.org, a new online research platform set up by Britain's University of East Anglia and Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. At least 28 people have been killed in the Australian fires that have destroyed 2,000 homes and razed 11.2 million hectares, nearly half the area of the United Kingdom. After weeks of criticism over his handling of the crisis, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday he would propose a high-powered inquiry into the disaster, including the impact of climate change."

Power companies retired or converted roughly 15,100 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired electricity generation, enough to power about 15 million homes, according to the data, which included preliminary statistics from the Energy Information Administration and Reuters reporting. That was second only to the record 19,300 MW shut in 2015 during President Barack Obama’s administration. The replacement of coal with power generation from natural gas and renewables has cut total U.S. carbon emissions in four of the past five years. Gas emits about half the carbon dioxide, a leading contributor to global warming, as coal. The coal industry has been in steep decline for a decade due to competition from cheap and abundant gas and subsidized solar and wind energy, along with rising public concern over coal’s contribution to climate change. Trump has downplayed climate change threats and sought to revive the coal industry to fulfill pledges to voters in coal mining states like West Virginia and Wyoming, mainly by rolling back Obama-era environmental protections. Still, since entering office in 2017, an estimated 39,000 MW of coal-fired power plant capacity has shut. If that trend continues, more coal plants will have shut during the first four years (2017-2020) of the Trump administration - an estimated 46,600 MW - than during Obama's second term (2013-2016) - around 43,100 MW.

In 2019, U.S. emissions linked to climate change fell 2.1per cent as coal-fired electricity output dropped 18per cent to the lowest level since 1975, according to an estimate by independent researcher Rhodium Group. But Rhodium said further big emissions reductions from coal retirements would be harder to achieve because many of the remaining facilities are commercially competitive.

Soaring SUV sales keep carmakers on collision course with climate policy=10 Jan 2020 07:36PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/soaring-suv-sales-keep-carmakers-on-collision-course-with-climate-policy-12251176=" FRANKFURT: Soaring demand for SUVs drove record sales for premium carmakers including BMW and Mercedes last year, leaving the industry on collision course with government efforts to tackle global warming despite big investments in electric vehicles. BMW said on Friday deliveries by its main luxury brand rose 2per cent to a record 2,168,516 vehicles last year, thanks to a 21per cent jump in sales of its "X" branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) which now make up 44per cent of the BMW brand's global sales. At Mercedes-Benz, the world's best selling premium car brand, every third luxury car sold last year was an SUV. Automakers across the world are investing billions in electric vehicles to try to meet tougher emissions regulations. But the jury is out on how many drivers will buy them. "Consumer preferences for SUVs could offset the benefits from electric cars," the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in its November World Energy Outlook 2019 report. The IEA said a doubling in market share had seen emissions from SUVs grow by nearly 0.55 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the last decade to roughly 0.7 gigatons. As a result, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 after the power sector - ahead of heavy industry including iron and steel, cement, aluminum, as well as trucks and aviation, it said. There are now more than 200 million SUVs around the world, up from about 35 million in 2010, accounting for 60per cent of the increase in the global car fleet since 2010, IEA data shows. "If the popularity of SUVs continues to rise in line with recent trends, this could add another 2 million barrels per day to our projection for 2040 oil demand," it said. BMW and Mercedes-Benz say their vehicles are among the most fuel efficient available, thanks to hybrid and other technologies which are already available on the market. Both carmakers, which say they aim to achieve new sales records this year, are preparing to launch fully electric SUVs - the BMW iX3 and Mercedes-Benz EQC - which they say shows a commitment to a cleaner future. EFFICIENCY GAINS While acknowledging the growing popularity of SUVs, Germany's powerful VDA auto industry association said much of the demand was for more efficient models. "Only just under 5per cent of SUVs are large luxury class vehicles. The market success of the SUV segment is mainly due to the model offensive in compact and medium-sized SUVs, with correspondingly lower fuel consumption," VDA said on Thursday. The newly registered SUVs of German group brands had reduced their CO2 emissions by 35per cent since 2008, it added. BMW plans to launch 25 hybrid and electric cars by 2023, with more than 12 models being fully electric versions. By 2025, half of all its cars are expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles, it said. Daimler-owned Mercedes expects half of its sales to be hybrid or electric by 2030, with Europe reaching the 50per cent mark in 2025. Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, said German carmakers pushed sales of higher-margin SUVs last year ahead of the introduction of more stringent European clean air rules in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2019 there was an unusually large rise in commercial registrations in Germany, Italy and Britain compared with figures for private consumers, in a sign carmakers were pushing certain models into the market. "From January 2020 onwards, new car fleets need to adhere to limits so as not to face large fines," Fuss said. "We will not see the same growth rates in this segment as we did last year." Electric car registrations are expected to take off in mid 2020, Fuss said. But that will depend on drivers being prepared to buy them, and perhaps also on how cheaply manufacturers are prepared to sell them. (Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Potter)"
White House unveils plan to speed big projects permits, sidestepping climate concern=09 Jan 2020 10:06PM=Reuters/ga=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/white-house-unveils-plan-to-speed-big-projects-permits--sidestepping-climate-concern-12247774=" WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Thursday (Jan 9) unveiled a plan to speed permitting for major infrastructure projects like oil pipelines, including by dropping consideration of their potential impact on climate change. The plan, released by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), would help the administration advance big energy projects like the Keystone XL oil pipeline that had been tied up over concerns about their effect on global warming. President Donald Trump planned to announce the proposal at the White House at 11am. The proposal, if enacted, would mark the first overhaul in four decades of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a bedrock environmental regulation. It is part of US President Donald Trump's broader effort to cut regulatory red tape to boost industry. "The proposed rule seeks to reduce unnecessary paperwork and delays, and to promote better decision-making consistent with NEPA's statutory requirements," said a CEQ fact sheet about the proposed change seen by Reuters. The rule says federal agencies would not need to factor in the climate impact of a project, making it easier for major fossil fuel projects to sail through the approval process and avoid legal challenges. Over the last few years, federal courts have ruled that NEPA requires the federal government to consider a project's carbon footprint in decisions related to leasing public lands for drilling or building pipelines. The proposed change also would widen the categories of projects that can be excluded from NEPA altogether. If a type of project got a "categorical exclusion" from one agency in the past, for example, it would automatically be excluded from review by other agencies, according to the plan. For projects requiring detailed environmental impact assessments, the rule would limit the review period to two years and the length of the report. According to CEQ, the average length of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement is currently 600 pages and takes 4.5 years to conclude. U.S. federal agencies prepare approximately 170 such assessments per year. Trump, a commercial real estate developer before becoming president, frequently complained that the NEPA permitting process took too long. Some of the country's biggest industry groups, including the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, also have complained about lengthy permitting delays. Environmental groups warned the plan will remove a powerful tool to protect local communities from the adverse impacts of a hastily designed and reviewed project. "Today's destructive actions by Trump, if not blocked by the courts or immediately reversed by the next president, will have reverberations for decades to come,” said Rebecca Concepcion Apostol, US program director at Oil Change International, an environmental group. The plan will go through a public comment period before being finalised."
Swiss climate activists appear in court over Credit Suisse 'tennis' protest=07 Jan 2020 11:16PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/swiss-climate-activists-appear-in-court-over-credit-suisse--tennis--protest-12241612=" LAUSANNE, Switzerland: A dozen Swiss climate activists appeared in court on Tuesday after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis inside branches of Credit Suisse bank last year in a stunt intended to highlight the bank's fossil fuel investments and "stop people acting like nothing is happening." The young activists, mostly students, were fined 21,600 Swiss francs (16,973 pounds) for trespassing at Credit Suisse branches in November 2018. Lawyers for the students who are appealing the fine said on Tuesday they were acting as whistleblowers for the climate emergency. "..It is not enough to just go out on the street or to vote, we must disturb a little bit so people stop acting like nothing is happening," Paul Castelain, one of the activists, told Reuters outside a courtroom in Renens, a suburb of Lausanne. Video footage from 2018 shows students dressed in tennis whites playing matches inside Credit Suisse branches in Lausanne and Geneva to underscore Swiss tennis star Roger Federer's sponsorship deal with the bank, which they want him to drop because of its fossil fuels investments. Federer did not immediately respond to a request for comment via his Foundation. Credit Suisse, which had filed charges against the activists, said it respected their cause but deemed their actions unacceptable. "Combating global warming is important," it said in an emailed statement. "Credit Suisse respects freedom of expression as a fundamental democratic right. to protect its clients, employees and branches, it does not tolerate unlawful attacks on its branches, irrespective of the perpetrators and their motives." Pressure is rising on Switzerland's financial sector to divest from fossil fuels and thousands of students have marched through Swiss cities in recent months demanding action on climate change. A swing to the left in an October election has boosted their demands. Credit Suisse in December said it will stop financing the development of new coal-fired power plants although activists at the court said this was not enough. It said on Tuesday it was also seeking to align its loan portfolios with objectives set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change. A ruling is due on Jan. 13.

Businesses using paper instead of plastic? Not necessarily better for the environment, experts say=03 Jan 2020 06:15AM (Updated: 06 Jan 2020 12:10PM)=CNA/ja=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/businesses-using-paper-instead-of-plastic-not-necessarily-better-12200916=" SINGAPORE: Plastic has developed a bad reputation for the impact it has on the environment. Ocean conservancy groups have estimated that about 8 million tonnes of plastic-based products from bags to bottles and straws end up in the sea each year harming marine life. Plastic items also choke landfills. This has led some businesses in Singapore to switch to alternative materials such as paper for their packaging in the belief that they are better for the environment. At eateries, paper boxes, straws and cups are becoming common. Some retailers are also switching to paper bags to pack items for their customers. Optician Eyewear Optics made the switch in October last year in the interest of the environment, the firm’s director Alex Chong told CNA. “All along, for two decades, we were using plastic, and realised it’s harmful, toxic. We are given a choice - spend a bit more and save the Earth, so we decided to do that,” he said. Plain Vanilla bakery also swapped its plastic straws for metal ones and switched to paper cups lined with polylactic acid (PLA), a plant-based plastic alternative. But some experts say that packaging products made from paper are not necessarily more eco-friendly. They are in fact more resource intensive to produce. PAPER BAGS GET CONTAMINATED EASILY Environmental expert and founder of non-profit group Plastic-Lite Singapore Ms Aarti Giri said: “Plastic seems to have become the punching bag in society.” But paper bags are likely to fill up a landfill faster as they take up more space, she added. The use of paper also leads to deforestation, one of the primary causes of climate change, Ms Giri said. Mr Liow Chean Siang, head of environmental certifications at the Singapore Environment Council, said that even if paper products like bags are “100 per cent recyclable”, once they are contaminated by items such as food, they will need to be disposed of as general waste. “Depending on the degree of contamination, the full contents of the blue recycling bins may be unfit for recycling and require incineration as general waste,” he said. “Paper bags are generally heavier than plastic bags. This increases their carbon footprint in transportation. The paper bags have to be reused at least a few times to be more environmentally friendly than plastic bags. Thus, if the paper bag becomes a single-use one, its environmental footprint might be bigger,” Mr Liow said. According to a "life cycle assessment of grocery carrier bags" report published by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency last year, common supermarket plastic bags "are the carriers providing the overall lowest environmental impact" even when they are not reused. A paper bag would need to be reused up to 43 times before having a net environmental benefit, as opposed to the common plastic bag that needs to be reused once to have the same benefit. However, reusing these paper bags can be challenging as they tend to tear, the experts said. NO FACILITIES HERE FOR BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCTS Some firms pride themselves in using biodegradable paper products, which by definition are capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms. They see that as an eco-friendly solution. However, such items have no benefit for the environment in Singapore’s context, the experts said. “It doesn’t make much difference in Singapore that paper products are biodegradable when most of the waste is incinerated,” said co-founder of zero-waste store Florence Tay. She explained that biodegradable paper breaks down in very specific conditions when mixed with other materials, which means that left in a landfill, they will not decompose. They will likely need to be broken down in a facility, which Singapore does not have, she said. On the other hand, standard paper cups and boxes are typically lined with plastic and therefore neither recyclable nor compostable. PLA-LINED PRODUCTS COME WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS While polylactic acid-lined products may appear to be a better solution, Ms Giri said that they present their own problems. PLA is derived from renewable resources such as corn, tapioca and sugarcane. "Corn is commonly used, and because it is modified to be hardy, higher quantities of fertilisers and chemical pesticides tend to be used during their growth which results in water and soil pollution," she said. Ms Giri said the PLA industry may worsen another urgent problem- food shortage, because PLA is usually cultivated on land that could be better used to grow food. "Agricultural land has always been a very precious commodity, more so now, especially now as we may be seeing more acute food shortages worldwide stemming from global warming, she said. "It's like a soothing balm but the wound stemming from our single-use or disposable lifestyle may not really heal," Ms Giri said. When asked why Plain Vanilla settled on PLA-lined paper cups, chief executive Vanessa Kenchington said: “Of all the available materials available in the Singapore market now, PLA is the most environmentally friendly option material that meets our requirements.”   She added that the firm did thorough research and spoke to people in the single-use food packaging industry to understand its options before committing to PLA-lined paper cups in February this year. Another factor the firm had to consider was that a water-resistant lining is required for cups to hold liquids, Ms Kenchington said. The PLA-lined cups cost almost double that of the plastic cups the eatery previously used. The firm also adopts other eco-friendly practices such as using beeswax wrap instead of cling wrap to store food. "We have learnt that often the best we can do to be environmentally responsible is to go with the lesser of the two available evils,and at the moment, this means that we cannot fully close the loop due to the lack of existing infrastructure in this regard," she said. While businesses want to show that they are doing something good for the environment, the solution does not lie with choosing one material over another, experts said. They should avoid single-use items altogether in favour of reusables, added the experts. Businesses can start making their customers question their need for a bag regardless of what material it is made of, suggested Ms Tay. "Instead of asking if customers need a bag, they could suggest that they put the item in their own bag.""
Oil climbs on US-China trade optimism, Middle East tensions===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/oil-climbs-on-us-china-trade-optimism--middle-east-tensions-12226554=" SEOUL: Oil prices rose on the first trading day of 2020 as warming trade relations between the United States and China eased demand concerns, and rising tensions in the Middle East raised worries about supply. Global benchmark Brent crude futures , were up 21 cents, or 0.3per cent, to 66.21 a barrel by 0130 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 21 cents, or 0.3per cent, at US$61.27 per barrel. Oil markets were closed on Wednesday for New Year's Day. Both benchmarks ended higher in 2019, posting their biggest annual gains since 2016, buoyed at the end of the year by a thaw in the prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - and a deeper output cut pledged by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. "Oil remains supported by the back-burner trade truce and the uptick in political unrest in Iraq," said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader. Geopolitical risks remain in the Middle East after U.S air strikes against the Iran-backed Katib Hezbollah militia group over the weekend. Protesters, angry at the air strikes, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday, although they withdrew after U.S. deployed extra troops. In 2020, Brent is forecast to average US$63.07 a barrel, up from December's estimate of US$62.50, while WTI is forecast to average US$57.70 a barrel, up from December's estimate of US$57.30, as the OPEC-led supply cuts and the expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal boosted analysts' views on the prospects for the year, a Reuters poll showed. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. January also marks the start of the deeper output cuts by OPEC and its partners, including Russia. OPEC and its allies have agreed to cut a further of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, on top of their previous cut of 1.2 million bpd that started on Jan. 1 a year ago. A fall in U.S. crude inventories last week also supported prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.8 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 27, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 3.2 million barrels, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) released on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Friday as the release has been delayed by two days by the New Year's holiday. (Reporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Tom Hogue)"
Commentary: Things you love that are being wrecked by climate change==CNA/el(sl)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-global-warming-effect-impact-extreme-weather-fire-12220232=" CANBERRA: There are so many stories flying around about the horrors already being wrought by climate change, you’re probably struggling to keep up. The warnings have been there for decades but still there are those who deny it. So perhaps it’s timely to look at how climate change is affecting you, by wrecking some of the things you love. 1. HOLIDAYS We often choose holiday destinations with weather in mind. Sadly, climate change may see your usual destinations become less inviting, and maybe even disappear entirely. But there’s more to think about than your favourite beach retreat being drowned, or the Great Barrier Reef decaying before you see it. Now we have to worry that “extreme weather events pose significant risks to travellers”. The warnings here range from travel disruption, such as delayed flights due to storms, to severe danger from getting caught in cyclones, floods or snowstorms. Simply getting where you need to go could become an adventure holiday in itself, but not a fun one. 2. WILDLIFE There are more and more examples of animals falling victim to extreme weather events induced by climate change, such as the horrific mass “cremations” of koalas in the path of recent Australian bush fires or bats dropping dead during heatwaves.   On top of that, news of the latest climate-related animal extinctions are becoming as common as reports of politicians doing nothing about it. 3. HISTORY AND HERITAGE The Italian city of Venice recently experienced its worst flooding since the mid-1960s, and the local mayor clearly connected this with climate change. Aside from the human calamity unfolding there, we are seeing one of Europe’s most amazing and unique cities and a World Heritage site devastated before our eyes. Climate change threatens more than 13,000 archaeological sites in North America alone if sea levels rise by 1m. That goes up to more than 30,000 sites if sea levels rise by 5m. UNESCO is worried that climate change also threatens underwater heritage sites, such as ruins and shipwrecks. For example, rising salinity and warming waters increases ship-worm populations that consume wooden shipwrecks in the Baltic sea. 4. SNOW SPORTS Warming temperatures have already had negative impacts on the US snow sports industry since at least 2001. In Australia, ski resorts are expected to see significant drops in snow fall by 2040 and, as temperatures warm, they will be unable to compensate for this by snow-making, because it doesn’t work if ambient temperatures are too high.   Perhaps recent efforts to make artificial snow will give us a few more years on the slopes, but I’m not holding my breath. 5. SPORTS AND EXERCISE It’s not just snow sports that will be affected. As temperatures warm, simply being outside in some parts of the world will not only be less pleasant, but more harmful, causing greater risk of heat stress doing any sports or exercise. That also means lower incentives for – and greater difficult in undertaking – incidental exercise, such as walking to the bus stop. 6. COFFEE As the climate changes, your coffee hits will probably become rarer and more expensive, too. A report by the Climate Institute in 2016 suggested coffee production could drop by 50 per cent by 2050. Given how rapidly negative climate predictions have been updated in the three years since, this might now be considered optimistic. Yikes. 7. HEALTH As the climate changes, the health of your children, your parents and your grandparents will be at greater risk through increases in air pollution, heatwaves and other factors.   It can be heartening to see the strong, intelligent and positive action being taken by the world’s youth in response to the lack of climate action by many governments. But the fact that this is a result of a literal existential crisis becoming a normal part of everyday life for young people is utterly horrifying. 8. HOMES The recent bush fires in Australia and the United States reveal how dramatic and destructive the effects climate change can be to where you live. Hundreds of houses have already burned down in Australia this fire season. Fires are getting more frequent and more ferocious. The seasonal windows where we safely used controlled burning to clear bushfire fuel are shrinking. It’s not only harder to fight fires when they happen, it’s becoming harder to prevent them as well. Fires aren’t the only threat to homes. All around the planet, more and more houses are being destroyed by rising seas and increasingly wild storms, all thanks to climate change. 9.WINE Still not convinced climate change is wrecking things you love? What if I told you it’s even coming for your wine? Less water, soil degradation and higher temperatures earlier in the season all lead to dramatic negative effects on grapes and wine-making.   One small upside is that disruption to traditional wine growing regions is creating opportunities to develop new wine growing areas. But there is no reason to believe these areas will maintain stable grape growing conditions as climate change progresses. WHAT NOW? It’s easy to be sad. But to change our trajectory, it’s better to be mad. In the words of that great English singer songwriter John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), “anger is an energy”. So maybe use this list as motivation to think, talk and act. Use it as fuel to make small, large or a combination of changes. Share your concerns, share your solutions, and do this relentlessly. What’s happening right now is huge, overwhelming, and also inevitable without concerted action. There’s no sugar-coating it: climate change is wrecking the things we love. Time to step it up a notch.

Commentary: The Singapore economy in 2020 - stabilisation or more uncertainties on the horizon?==CNA/sl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-economy-outlook-2020-labour-market-sectors-12222200=" SINGAPORE: 2019 has been a roller-coaster ride for financial markets and the global economy including Asia. Geopolitics has loomed large over business sentiments. The year has been driven by US President Donald Trump’s frequent tweets, bouts of market volatility and geopolitical tensions on both the trade and technology fronts, the never-ending drama called Brexit, and much hand-wringing over China’s ongoing growth slowdown, among others. Despite initial market fears about a US recession, the US economy escaped a contraction. Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, had ridden quickly to the rescue with interest rate cuts and liquidity provisions. Hence, notwithstanding the economic uncertainties and bouts of risk-aversion, financial markets still performed fairly well as illustrated by the S&P 500’s continued surge. At home, the Singapore economy managed to avert a technical recession in the third quarter of 2019, albeit with full-year growth likely to come in at the lower end of the official growth forecast range. THE OUTLOOK FOR SINGAPORE IN 2020 Looking ahead, there are some tentative green shoots on the macroeconomic front, including favourable borrowing conditions and a slightly stronger outlook for emerging markets. But we should remain cautious not to count the chickens before they hatch, given that many factors, such as the US-China bilateral relationship, can turn in an instance. The Singapore economy may eke out modestly improved growth prospects of 1 to 2 per cent year-on-year in 2020, versus a subdued 0.5 to 1.0 per cent forecast range for 2019.   This assumes that the global trade tensions do not escalate further from here and the manufacturing and trade outlook sees a modicum of stabilisation. Moreover, the challenges ahead for the Singapore economy over the next few years may be more structural and difficult to navigate. Take for instance, climate change, which has manifested in fires, floods and global warming, and will require significant investments for countries adapting to a changed environment. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had earlier highlighted the need for US$100 billion for the Singapore economy to prepare for rising sea levels at the National Day Rally in 2019. The greying of the Singapore population with attendant health, retirement and housing planning needs could also strain fiscal resources over the long term. The rise of the gig economy also poses fresh challenges for policymakers who now have to think about how to strengthen job security, plan for medium-term career development and approach retirement needs for workers in this new economy. THE BIG RISKS FROM THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT The good news is major economies appear to be navigating global economic headwinds well thus far, although Eurozone growth remains sluggish for now. That said, the US is heading into an election cycle and if the impeachment process against incumbent president Trump is any guide, the noise level is likely to remain elevated in 2020. In Asia, regional economies are carefully treading the bifurcation of manufacturing supply and trading chains as businesses adopt a “China plus one” approach to avoid US-China trade tariffs.   The biggest risk for the Singapore economy remains the fragility of the external environment and the prospect of anaemic global growth amid uncertainties pertaining to US-China tensions beyond trade, Brexit, China’s slowdown, and geopolitical hotspots (such as the Hong Kong unrest) which could continue to weigh on business and consumer confidence. CHALLENGES TO SPECIFIC SECTORS Sectoral challenges remain mixed for the Singapore economy. The services and construction sectors are likely to provide the bulwark for 2020 growth, even if manufacturing sector stages a modest recovery. Manufacturing, especially electronics, has been suffering a global demand slowdown, coupled with the wax and wane of the US-China trade war that has impacted both business and consumer confidence. While there were tentative signs of a bottoming- out in the middle of 2019, a quick V-shaped upturn remains elusive for now, although there are hopes that the 5G implementation will lend a helping hand going forward. There are also hopes the impending conclusion of a US-China Phase 1 trade deal heralds a more reconciliatory trade relationship. Still, domestic demand conditions may remain subdued due to the lack of fresh growth catalysts. The outlook for cyclical industries, like retail, remain challenging due to a combination of supply-side factors like high operating costs including rents and the ongoing manpower crunch, whereas the demand side is likely restrained by potential belt-tightening in households. SINGAPORE’S LABOUR MARKET WILL REMAIN RESILIENT The domestic labour market had stayed relatively resilient over the course of 2019. Although the overall unemployment rate had crept up to a 10-year high of 2.3 per cent, retrenchments for the 12 months to September 2019 was actually lower at 10,490, compared to the same period a year before (11,900) and in 2017 (16,480).   Hiring intentions have turned more cautious, which explains in part why resident wage growth for the first nine months of 2019 had come down slightly to 3.3 per cent, down from 3.7 per cent for the same period a year ago. However, looking ahead, the services sector will have to grapple with the Dependency Ratio Ceiling cut from 40 per cent to 38 per cent from Jan 1, 2020 for the proportion of foreign workers on work permits or S Passes, with a further cut to 35 per cent from Jan 1, 2021. This may buffer against any softening of the domestic labour market amid an expected lacklustre growth recovery environment in 2020. Growth industries likely to offer employment opportunities include healthcare, education services, information and communications (ICT), and finance and insurance. The unemployment rate may hover around the 2.3 to 2.5 per cent in the interim, but should avoid the sharp spikes seen in the global financial crisis back in 2009. The biggest challenge for labour remains keeping up with advances in technology. In the medium term, with the advent of the Internet of Things, automation, and the employment of artificial intelligence, Singapore is expected to see the largest disruption in its workforce among ASEAN countries. Singapore may see a faster and more widespread digital transformation compared to its ASEAN peers. Major upskilling or reskilling will be needed for the labour force to stay relevant and fill new jobs created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is likely to remain a key focus for policymakers. EXPECTATIONS FOR POLICY SUPPORT AND BUDGET 2020 There is space for a stronger fiscal response at the upcoming 2020 Budget, after a more accommodative monetary policy in 2019. Market attention is increasingly focused on what is touted to be a pre-election budget. Looking around the region, Singapore would not be alone if it unveils a more expansionary budget. Countries around the region have announced proactive fiscal policy support including China, South Korea, Thailand and India. Japan has announced a stimulus package amounting to some 13 trillion yen (S$160 billion), while Hong Kong has announced waves of fiscal packages to tackle its recession.   Many Singaporeans will look to Budget 2020 for aid for workers and companies. To better assist displaced workers and SMEs to ride out these challenging times, it may be timely to top up the SkillsFuture Credit scheme from the initial S$500 per Singaporean and offer more work transition support by scaling up the Professional Conversion Programmes. For SMEs, greater assistance in terms of enterprise capability building, innovation and internationalisation efforts in light of the global trade tensions will be likely. We should also expect Budget 2020 to reflect a focus on medium-term priorities such as healthcare, education, security (including cybersecurity and food security), productivity improvements and environmental and financial sustainability. Budget 2020 may also provide greater clarity on how to fund the S$100 billion to combat climate change. Aside from any stimulus package to tackle concerns over the state of the economy and measures to support businesses, many will also look to Budget 2020 for support for households. There had been strong hints of a GST offset package in the offing. Without a specific timeline on the actual implementation of the planned GST hike from 7 to 9 per cent, it may be premature to speculate on the actual quantum of the 2020 GST offset package. The focus of social programmes will likely target low-income households and seniors and costs of living concerns. For the new year in 2020, one has to be thankful that many much touted external downside growth risks did not materialise, and look forward with an air of cautious optimism that the global and regional economy will improve from a very volatile 2019.

I'm using all my strength to fight climate change, says Merkel=31 Dec 2019 07:46AM=Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/i-m-using-all-my-strength-to-fight-climate-change--says-merkel-12221728=" BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a her New Year's message she is fighting climate change with all her strength to enable future generations to live in peace and prosperity. "Global warming is real. It is threatening," Merkel said in the recorded speech which will be broadcasted on Tuesday evening. Rising world temperatures and the problems created by global warming are all man-made, Merkel added. "So we have to do everything humanly possible to overcome this human challenge. It is still possible," Merkel said. "At 65, I am at an age at which I personally will no longer experience all the consequences of climate change that will occur if politicians do not act," the chancellor said. "It will be our children and grandchildren who have to live with the consequences of what we do or refrain from doing today. That is why I use all my strength to ensure that Germany makes its contribution - ecologically, economically, socially - to getting climate change under control." Merkel called on Germans to think out of the box to cope with the challenges arising from global warming. "To do this, we need more than ever the courage to think in a new way, the strength to leave familiar paths, the willingness to try new things, and the determination to act faster, convinced that the unusual can succeed - and must succeed if the generation of today's young people and their descendants should still be able to live well on this Earth," Merkel said."
I wouldn't have wasted my time on Trump, says Greta Thunberg=30 Dec 2019 07:50PM=Reuters/zl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greta-thunberg-donald-trump-waste-my-time-un-summit-12220810=" LONDON: Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg said on Monday (Dec 30) that talking to US President Donald Trump at a United Nations summit on global warming would have been a waste of time since he would not have paid any attention. In an interview with BBC radio's Today programme, for which she was the guest editor on Monday, Thunberg also said she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life. A video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a "death stare" at a UN climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agrement on global warming.   Asked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Thunberg said: "Honestly, I don't think I would have said anything because obviously he's not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me? "So I probably wouldn't have said anything, I wouldn't have wasted my time," she said. This month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Thunberg "a brat". Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem. "Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don't mean anything," she said. "I guess of course it means something - they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don't want - but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat." Thunberg came to world attention when she began a grassroots campaign aged 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change. PRAISE FROM DAVID ATTENBOROUGH Thunberg, who was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering. She also spoke in Monday's BBC programme with veteran British broadcaster David Attenborough, telling him how his nature documentaries had inspired her.   "You have aroused the world," the 93-year-old Attenborough told Thunberg in reply, adding that she had achieved things "that many of us who have been working on the issue for 20 years have failed to do". Her father Svante Thunberg, also interviewed for the BBC programme, said she had dealt very well with "the fake news, all the things that people try to fabricate about her, the hate that that generates" while in the global media limelight. "Quite frankly, I don't know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious," he said.   The teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid. "I hope I won't have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don't have to be a climate activist any more," she said on Monday, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August. "I just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager.""
2019 was hottest year on record for Russia=30 Dec 2019 07:44PM (Updated: 30 Dec 2019 07:50PM)=AFP/ad=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2019-was-hottest-year-on-record-for-russia-12220778=" MOSCOW: This year was the hottest ever registered in Russia, the country's weather chief said on Monday (Dec 30), as climate change pushes global temperatures to record highs. "This year in Russia was the hottest for the entire period of instrumental observations," the head of the Gidromedtsentr weather service, Roman Vilfand, told Russian news agencies. He said Moscow's average temperature for 2019 had hit 7.6-7.7 degrees Celsius, beating the previous record by 0.3 degrees. Weather records have been kept since 1879 in Moscow and since 1891 in Russia as a whole. Global warming has sent temperatures rising around the world, with the United Nations saying earlier this month that 2019 was on course to be one of the three hottest years on record. Known for its notoriously harsh winters, Moscow has seen its warmest December in a century this year. While some flurries fell on Monday, the Russian capital - normally covered with a blanket of snow by mid-December - saw a largely snowless and cloudy last month of the year. The city's ski resorts were closed and spring buds were beginning to show on trees - three or more months too early. Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been reluctant to acknowledge the link between human activity and global warming. At his traditional year-end annual news conference earlier this month, Putin insisted that "nobody knows" the causes of climate change. But he acknowledged the consequences of global warming could be catastrophic for a country that is one of the world's biggest producers of carbon fuel and with a fifth of its land within the Arctic circle. Putin said that the rate of warming for Russia was 2.5 per cent higher than elsewhere on the planet. And "for our country, this process is very serious", he said."
BoE's Carney says finance must act faster on climate change===https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/boe-s-carney-says-finance-must-act-faster-on-climate-change-12220434=" LONDON: Financial services have been too slow to cut investment in fossil fuels, a delay that could lead to a sharp increase in global temperatures, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in an interview broadcast on Monday. Carney, due to become the United Nations' special envoy for climate change next year when he steps down from the bank, told BBC radio that global warming could render the assets of many financial companies worthless. Carney cited pension fund analysis that showed the policies of companies pointed to global warming of 3.7 to 3.8 degrees Celsius, compared with the 1.5-degree target outlined in the Paris Agreement on climate change. "The concern is whether we will spend another decade doing worthy things but not enough... and we will blow through the 1.5C mark very quickly," Carney said in a radio program guest edited by teenage environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. "As a consequence, the climate will stabilize at the much higher level." Carney said the financial sector had made a lot of progress in disclosing the risks to their assets from climate change, but he warned that progress was not fast enough. He called on political leaders to effect change today and avoid selective information and spin. "To deliver, there needs to be shared understanding about what's necessary. it is reasonable for there to be debates at the margin about where does the role of the state stop and what's the role of markets," Carney said. He said there would need to be a mix of public investment and change driven by financial markets because of their power to reflect judgments about the future value of assets in a world affected by climate change. Earlier this month, the BoE said Britain's top banks and insurers should be tested together for the first time in 2021 to quantify the potential financial damage from climate change on their businesses.

From skincare to makeup: The biggest beauty trends that defined the 2010s=30 Dec 2019 06:30AM (Updated: 30 Dec 2019 07:00AM)=CNA/yy=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/beauty-skincare-makeup-trends-12205182=" Change is a constant – that’s a fact – and 10 years worth of it represent quite a substantial amount of developments to look back on. A lot of it can be found within the beauty industry, which has made a significantly big shift in just about every aspect this past decade. There’s the exciting and the surprising, a whole lot of crazy, as well as plenty of upgrades in terms of beauty technology. More importantly, the 2010s have brought about a change in consumers’ mindset toward beauty – as we become more knowledgeable about the industry and the products we put on our skin, we want our skincare and cosmetics not just to be more safe and effective, but also to be more environmentally friendly. Which trends have gotten us into buying frenzies, and which ones should stay or be tossed away? Let us look back and review the happenings that have defined our beauty tastes and routines. THE KOREAN WAVE A post shared by Sulwhasoo Singapore (@sulwhasoo.singapore) on Jul 27, 2019 at 8:00pm PDT The biggest beauty movement to take the world by storm in the last decade is the K-beauty wave. Sheet masks (for the face and various parts of the body), the 10-step skincare routine as well as a plethora of products that the rest of the world had never seen or tried before – like the cushion compact, sleeping mask, as well as weird skincare ingredients like snail slime and donkey’s milk – are just some of the things it brought with it. The biggest beauty movement to take the world by storm in the last decade is, of course, the K-beauty wave. These Korean trends may no longer be hot news anymore, but they are still going on strong and have also left evidence of their influence on Western cosmetic brands, which have developed their own versions of some of these Korean products. THE GADGET AGE A post shared by FOREO (@foreo) on Dec 21, 2019 at 1:09pm PST Technology changes everything, not least the way we go about our beauty routine. Fingers, it seems, no longer suffice as application and blending tools when it comes to putting on skincare and makeup. Instead, a nifty gadget or two are now required if you wish to improve how these products perform on your skin. From microcurrent and jade facial rollers to LED light skincare devices, there’s an implement to suit every need and budget. These promise a variety of benefits – they can soothe skin and boost the penetration of skincare products, firm and tighten skin or even target acne problems. A nifty gadget or two are now required if you wish to improve how these products perform on your skin. Makeup application tools, particularly those used for foundation, have gotten more advanced than ever before. Ye olde wedge sponge may still be able to accomplish the job but the finish that it gives is nothing like the flawless results that a Beauty Blender, vibrating sponge applicator or Artis brush can give you. CONTOURING CRAZE A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 17, 2019 at 3:18pm PST Thanks to social media and the advent of “Instagram makeup”, contouring and highlighting have both grown into huge trends and become essential steps in every beauty influencer’s LOTD. The trend speedily opened up a whole new product category in beauty – suddenly, cosmetics brands were coming up with all manner of highlighting powders and contouring sticks, not to mention handy palettes combining a variety of these. These makeup tricks for helping celebrities look better on screen actually do work like a charm. Some credit (or blame) the Kardashian and Jenner clans for starting this potentially streaky-looking trend, but the fact is that contouring and highlighting have actually been around for quite a while – seen as early as the 1930s on film stars like Marlene Dietrich. These makeup tricks for helping celebrities look better on screen actually do work like a charm, provided you don’t use them with too heavy a hand (as seen in many an influencer’s dramatic demonstration on Instagram). Remember that you are repurposing these shading techniques for real life and not for movie cameras. MATTE POUTS A post shared by Armani Beauty (@armanibeauty) on Dec 21, 2019 at 1:59am PST The matte lip is not a new thing, but it definitely defined the makeup look of the 2010s in an unprecedented way. It also paved the way for the arrival of a new product that is both loved and hated in equal parts – the liquid lipstick. This super-matte lip product gives full-impact, budge-proof colour in a few swipes but also tended to annihilate all moisture in the lips. Matte lips are likely to stick around albeit in a velvet, demi-matte finish that is more wearable. Even so, nothing stopped it from becoming a best-selling makeup product – just ask Kylie Jenner, who built her multi-million-dollar beauty empire on her liquid lip kits that kept on selling out when the first batches hit online stores. The liquid lipstick is still around, and, thankfully, is now available in formulas that are more forgiving on a dry pout. As we go into a new decade, matte lips are likely to stick around, albeit in a velvet, demi-matte finish that is more wearable and can be delivered via both a liquid or regular lipstick. SEMI-PERMANENT MAKEUP A post shared by Erabelle Singapore (@erabellesg) on Nov 12, 2018 at 2:25am PST One global trend that has really made its presence felt in Singapore in recent years is semi-permanent makeup. It’s not just eyebrow embroidery or microblading that can be done these days; one can practically get a full face of “makeup” that won’t fade or wash off at the end of the day – eyeliner, lip colour, even blush and a foundation-like skin base. They are not permanent and will fade in a matter of months, which means they aren’t irreversible should you decide on a change. Of course, while these new techniques are all essentially a form of tattooing, they aren’t like the permanent eyebrow tattooing of yore with pigments that fade to a ghastly green. Instead, they produce a natural finish, as well as offer a customisable intensity. Best of all, they are not permanent and will fade in a matter of months, which means they aren’t irreversible should you decide on a change. It’s easy to see why semi-permanent makeup is so popular now – not only is it a great time-saver, it also offers those who are hopeless at applying makeup a way to hold onto expertly made-up brows, eyes or lips for months on end. IN-YOUR-FACE HAIR A post shared by Evolve Salon (@evolve_salon) on Jan 31, 2018 at 3:32am PST It began with full-on peroxide-blonde and then morphed into a bizarre multicoloured rainbow trend. Then came pink, purple and grey, as well as ombre colouring techniques involving one or more of these outre shades for the hair. Never had a hair trend been so OTT and what’s more unusual is that it seems that the whole world is embracing it. We aren’t quite sure what to make of it – a bold hair colour change may be fun and super eye-catching, but certain colours are simply not work- or school-appropriate and, worse still, have turned many a head of hair into a dry and wiry mess with the damage caused by extensive bleaching. The health of your hair should be your top priority, because absolutely no colour will look good on hair that’s frizzy. Our vote goes to a more subtle approach – ashy-brown tones can be much more attractive and are far easier to maintain than a crazy-bright colour that leaches out of hair in barely two weeks. More importantly, the health of your hair should be your top priority, because absolutely no colour will look good on hair that’s frizzy. THE CLEAN MOVEMENT A post shared by Fresh (@freshbeauty) on Oct 1, 2019 at 7:06am PDT Ten years ago, no one really questioned what actually went into their skincare products as long as they felt good, smelled good and did what they’re supposed to do. So what if there were a bunch of words we didn’t recognise in the ingredient list? There wasn’t any information out there about them; besides, the general assumption back then was that no beauty company would put anything unsafe into the products that we are using. Fast-forward to 2020 and we now know the truth. Parabens, phthalates, sulphates and synthetic fragrances – some of the most widely used chemical ingredients in the beauty trade – could be responsible for irritating our skin or, worse still, may cause more severe health problems down the road. Parabens, phthalates, sulphates and synthetic fragrances could be responsible for irritating our skin or, worse still, may cause more severe health problems down the road. The rise of clean beauty came about with increasing levels of awareness about these harmful ingredients, opening up a new branch in the industry that is largely made up of smaller-scale brands producing nasties-free skincare. Of course, not all synthetic ingredients are harmful. At the same time, it is difficult to formulate some products or ensure their longevity without the use of certain essential synthetic ingredients. The key is in understanding which are the ones that are skin-friendly and safe for use. But while there are still points to be debated here, one thing is clear – clean beauty is here to stay and any beauty company that is seriously thinking about the future must have a foot in it. SUSTAINABLE BEAUTY A post shared by Drunk Elephant (@drunkelephant) on Dec 21, 2019 at 9:05am PST Global warming is all too real, and the beauty industry has a significant role to play in containing environmental damage. While efforts are still not as widely and speedily taken as they should be by the industry at large, it’s heartening to see more beauty brands going out of their way to ensure that their business practices are as sustainable as they can be. Global warming is all too real, and the beauty industry has a significant role to play in containing environmental damage. Packaging, for one, has started to change for the benefit of the environment – glass, instead of plastic; simpler packaging that does away with multiple layers of cardboard; as well as single-material bottles that create ease for recycling. Some brands are even offering perks to customers who bring in their empty product containers for recycling. Other brands have begun to look into sustainable and ethical sourcing of ingredients so that we may enjoy guilt-free beauty. Is it a tall order or a challenge that can actually be accomplished? The next 10 years will reveal the answer and hopefully get us much closer to being thoroughly environmentally friendly."
Commentary: Despite pressures against it, truth survived 2019==Project Syndicate/ml=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/2019-review-is-truth-dead-12214584=" LONDON – “Truthiness,” a concept coined by the American comedian Stephen Colbert, involves saying things that you want to believe are true even if there is no factual evidence to support these assertions. And without doubt, truthiness has had a great run in 2019 – from US President Donald Trump’s Washington, to the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom, to events in Asia. This disturbing trend was partly reflected in Time magazine’s choice of candidates for its 2019 Person of the Year. The shortlist of five included Trump, who, although he did not win the prize of seeing his picture on Time’s cover, exemplifies the political triumph of today’s ubiquitous mendacity. In the opposite corner were two other candidates: the whistleblower who exposed Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine’s president for political gain, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who presided over the chamber’s recent vote to impeach the president. TIME FOR TRUTH The two remaining contenders also represented old-fashioned honesty and political courage. The winner was Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate-change campaigner. Some patronize her, while others reject her arguments. But she represents the concerns of those who will inherit the future. Moreover, what Thunberg says bears the imprimatur of most of the world’s climate scientists. She wants world leaders to act to save the planet before it is too late. On a recent visit to Australia – first to Melbourne, and then to Sydney – I was surprised at the disconnect between the government’s position on climate change and the bushfires that are devastating New South Wales.   Almost 30 years ago, as Britain’s environment minister, I chaired the London conference that toughened up the Montreal Protocol in order to prevent further ozone depletion. The Australian government was one of that initiative’s major supporters, which was hardly surprising given that the hole in the ozone layer above Australia was expanding at the time. With forest fires now ringing Sydney, it is surprising that the current government still seems so complacent about climate change. In fact, some of its members sound as though they think global warming is all a hoax. PRO-DEMOCRACY Rounding out Time’s shortlist were Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaigners, who were saluted for protests that have been ongoing for more than six months. Quite apart from the demonstrators’ bravery and the principles they represent (most of the time peacefully), there are three reasons to see their actions as blows for the truth.   First, the demonstrators are correct to argue that the Chinese communist regime has reneged on the promises made to Hong Kong when China regained sovereignty over the city in 1997. Hong Kong’s citizens were assured that they would have a high degree of local autonomy and would continue living in a free society under the rule of law. But the city’s government has proved to be a subservient mouthpiece of the regime in Beijing. In practice, that means it does nothing to address the demonstrators’ legitimate grievances about the way they are governed and the lack of progress (despite many promises) with regard to democratic accountability in the last 20 years. Second, in addition to other complaints, the demonstrators have been incensed by the growing incidence of police brutality during the protests. There also have been clear breaches of humanitarian law in the treatment of health workers who were prevented from assisting injured demonstrators. The Hong Kong government says that it already has an adequate system for handling complaints against the police.   But that claim has been exposed as nonsense by the resignation of a panel of outside experts who were brought in to assess whether existing institutions dealing with police conduct were fit for purpose. Clearly, the panel’s members did not think that they could carry out their properly assigned task. STANDING IN SUPPORT Finally, Hong Kong’s citizens stood behind the demonstrators despite the violent behaviour of an extreme fringe as the protests continued. Although this minority perhaps was provoked by the government’s failure to engage with them or with the majority of entirely peaceful campaigners, their violence was and is unacceptable. Some – including China’s communist regime and its supporters in Hong Kong – believed that the violence would undermine public support for the demonstrators’ demands. Far from it. Hong Kong’s district council elections in November resulted in a sweeping victory for pro-democracy candidates, proving emphatically that there was no silent majority in support of the city’s government. On the contrary, the majority of not-so-silent citizens were in favour of democracy and the rule of law. Hong Kong’s demonstrators thus were on the side of truth: their city really did want to defend cherished values and hold its government and police to account. As we move into 2020, however, I feel very strongly that the demonstrators would be wise to try to end the violence and rely on the visible strength of their support to make their case. I still believe that, over time, the pressure of strong sentiment in Hong Kong and around the world is more likely to shift the totalitarian regime in Beijing than fighting the police and causing property damage are. Truthiness cast a dark shadow over public life in 2019, and probably will continue to do so next year. But fortunately for those who care about both democracy and the planet, the actual truth remains a powerful force. Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and a former EU commissioner for external affairs, is Chancellor of the University of Oxford."
Recession, robots and rockets: another roaring 20s for world markets?=27 Dec 2019 06:41PM (Updated: 27 Dec 2019 06:58PM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/recession--robots-and-rockets--another-roaring-20s-for-world-markets--12215650=" LONDON: Helicopter cash, climate crises, smart cities and the space economy - investors have all those possibilities ahead as they enter the third decade of the 21st century. They go into the new decade with a spring in their step, after watching world stocks add over US$25 trillion in value in the past 10 years and a bond rally put US$13 trillion worth of bond yields below zero. They also saw internet-based firms transform the way humans work, shop and relax. Now investors are positioning for the tech revolution's next 10 years. Could we see a repeat of the roaring twenties, as the 1920s were known - years of prosperity, technological innovation and such social developments as women winning the right to vote? Possibly. But there's unease, along with all the euphoria. The current economic cycle is already the longest in U.S. history and a recession looks inevitable in the new decade - which also will mark 100 years since the Wall Street crash of 1929. (Graphic: U.S. economic growth click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/258/258/ecogrowth.png) And solutions may need to be unconventional, even more so than the extraordinary policies of negative interest rates and bond-buying that eased the post-2008 global funk. With those policies maxed out, "in the 2020s it seems inevitable that a world of helicopter money awaits," Deutsche Bank predicts. That would entail central banks or governments providing citizens with large amounts of money, as though it was being dropped from helicopters, a strategy rejected even by the unorthodox policymakers of the 2010s. Another radical option under discussion is modern monetary theory, when governments create and spend as much money as needed, so long as inflation stays low. "Central banks have effectively invited governments to experiment with more unconventional policies," Deutsche said. However, those policies may pile up even more global debt, already at record highs. (Graphic: On the rise: U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/257/257/debttogdp.png) So what will markets do? A decade of rock-bottom interest rates didn't revive growth and inflation in developed nations, but they certainly inflated markets, as prices for bonds, equities and real estate show. The inequality they spawned have also triggered a widespread backlash against globalization. The result is a de-globalizing world, or as Morgan Stanley puts it, "slow-balisation". The bank expects tech investments to outperform, in particular smaller internet firms in China, as protectionism hurts larger rivals. But it predicts less exciting returns - "a lower and flatter frontier compared to prior decades, and especially compared to the ten years post-GFC (global financial crisis)." GLOBAL WARMING, PEOPLE AGEING As market returns cool, the planet will continue to heat up. Carbon emissions, temperatures, sea levels and thus climate-induced poverty and immigration are expected to rise. That should increasingly lead asset managers to seek alternatives to pollutants, especially coal, use of which must cease in OECD nations by 2030 for the Paris Agreement to be met. BofA expects clean energy and electric-vehicle companies to emerge as winners, estimating the clean energy market to be already worth US$300 billion. Ageing populations are another challenge, making demographics a key investment criterion. Deutsche Bank names Ireland, Rwanda, Ghana, Botswana and Laos as among the 22 nations in line for a "demographic dividend", benefiting from growing working-age populations. It also backed sectors like e-commerce as Generation Z, those who will be in their mid 20s to early 30s by 2030, exercise growing spending power. (Graphic: Growing old too fast: China’s workforce must support a larger population of elderly dependents Growing old too fast: China’s workforce must support a larger population of elderly dependents click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/breakingviews/1/1053/1418/Chinaper cent20demographics.png) But in some countries, affluent older spenders will still carry clout. By 2030, over 80s will represent 5.4per cent of the U.S. population, up from 3.7per cent in 2015, driving demand for retirement homes, healthcare and long-life innovations. "Immortality may prove the most interesting secular theme in the 2020s," BofA predicts. TECH TIPPING POINTS A World Economic Forum survey in 2017 predicted a series of "technological tipping points" for the coming decade. They included 3D-printed cars, driverless vehicles and the first artificial-intelligence machine on a company's board. (Graphic: Robot Shipments Hit New Record png click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-ECONOMY-ROBOTS/0H001PBF650Y/eikon.png) The '20s could be an era of smart cities, where big data and robotics ensure better governance, health and connectivity, UBS forecast. It expects annual spending to turn cities smart will reach US$2 trillion in 2025 and internet-connected devices will multiply more than four-fold to 46 billion. To take advantage of these shifts, investors will focus on areas such as autonomous vehicles - automated forklift shipments will grow to 455,000 in 2030 from 4,000 next year, ABI Research said. Finally, advances in rocket and satellite technology are opening investment access to the final frontier. The first exchange-traded fund dedicated to the space industry opened in 2019. UBS sees "parallels with how the global internet ... opened up vast opportunities at the turn of the century." It predicts the "space economy" https://tmsnrt.rs/2YpSX6Z will reach US$1 trillion in the next couple of decades, from US$340 billion now. The bank backs existing listed aerospace, satellite and communications companies and new space start-ups in private markets. (Reporting by Tom Arnold and Elizabeth Howcroft; editing by Sujata Rao)"

The year the world woke up to the climate emergency=26 Dec 2019 05:46PM (Updated: 26 Dec 2019 05:50PM)=AFP/ga=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/the-year-the-world-woke-up-to-the-climate-emergency-12212988=" PARIS: Schoolchildren skipping class to strike, protests bringing city centres to a standstill: armed with dire warnings from scientists, people around the world dragged the climate emergency into the mainstream in 2019. Spurred on by Swedish wunderkind Greta Thunberg - virtually unknown outside of her homeland a year ago but now a global star nominated for a Nobel prize - millions of young people took part in weekly demonstrations demanding climate action. And, like harbingers of the apocalypse, the Extinction Rebellion movement embarked on a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience that spread worldwide, armed with little more than superglue and the nihilistic motto: "When hope dies, action begins."   Although scientists have warned for decades about the risk to humanity and Earth posed by unfettered burning of fossil fuels, in 2019 - set to be the second hottest year in history - their message seems to have finally hit home. The 2015 Paris agreement saw nations commit to limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as a way of curbing the worst impacts of global warming. A safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius was included as a goal for nations to work towards.   With Earth having already warmed by 1 degree Celsius, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) dropped a bombshell late last year. Its landmark report in October 2018 laid the groundwork for the string of climate shockwaves that rumbled throughout 2019: The world is way off course for 1.5 degrees Celsius, and the difference between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius could be catastrophic. "The message from scientists was that each half-degree counts," said Amy Dahan, a science historian specialising in climate at France's National Centre for Scientific Research. It was a message heard around the world. For Corinne Le Quere, president of France's High Commission for Climate Change and member of Britain's Committee on Climate Change, 2019 was "something new". "I've worked on climate change for 30 years and for 29 of those, as scientists, we've worked unnoticed," she told AFP. The IPCC report concluded that global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030 - and reach "net zero" by 2050 - to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius. "It's given us a clear timeline: we have 12 years to act," said Caroline Merner, 24, a Canadian member of the Youth4Climate movement. The UN last month said carbon emissions must decline 7.6 per cent annually by 2030 to stand any chance of hitting 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists meanwhile said emissions this year will instead rise 0.6 percent. Despite growing mobilisation and awareness, COP25 - the climate summit in Madrid this month - barely squeezed out compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. ANNUS HORRIBILIS But while society and particularly younger generations appear to have woken up to the threat of climate catastrophe, industry shows little signs of sharing their urgency. Greenhouse gas emissions are once again set to rise in 2019 after hitting a record in 2018, as extreme weather events - made more likely as the planet warms - struck seemingly everywhere this year. Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, typhoon Hagibis in Japan, a deadly, record-breaking heatwave across much of Europe, wildfires in California and eastern Australia, floods in Venice ... the list goes on.   The threat posed by climate change became so stark in 2019 that Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth, decided to move its capital to somewhere that wasn't sinking. "We're seeing climate change with our own eyes," Le Quere said. "Reality is forcing us to act." The science came thick and fast this year, with the IPCC releasing two additional special reports on land use and oceans, and another UN body, IPBES, issuing a stunning warning of the threats posed by human activity to the natural world. Faced with an unbreachable body of evidence and mounting pressure from the streets, governments in 2019 started, slowly, to mobilise. A total of 66 nations now have plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The cities of London and Paris declared official ecological and climate emergencies. Yet there are fears meagre progress could be undermined as developing economies appear no closer to ditching fossil fuels and the United States - the largest historic emitter - looks poised to complete its Paris pullout. "CLIMATE MAKES US EQUAL" Environmental activism, of course, is nothing new. As Alfredo Jornet, professor at the University of Oslo, pointed out, indigenous peoples "have been very active for a long time" in protesting against climate change and deforestation, often to little fanfare. "It's easy to be worried about the climate when you have money and privilege," said Melina Sakiyama, 34, a Brazilian activist. With the deadline for countries' Paris commitments looming, as well as a series of high-profile environment summits in 2020, this year is unlikely to be a one-off in terms of climate action. "The question is how to mobilise this unrest in a way that can lead us to better, more peaceful, democratic and sustainable societies," said Jornet. "In a sense, climate change makes us all more equal. It makes us more capable of acting together.""
Australia PM defends coal as climate-fuelled bushfires burn=24 Dec 2019 03:08AM (Updated: 24 Dec 2019 03:10AM)=AFP/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-pm-defends-coal-as-climate-fuelled-bushfires-burn-12207680=" SYDNEY: Under-fire Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday (Dec 23) rejected calls for "reckless" and "job-destroying" cuts to the country's vast coal industry in the face of a deadly climate-fuelled bushfire crisis. Morrison's conservative government has fiercely defended the lucrative coal industry in Australia, which produces a third of global coal exports and provides work in swing electoral districts. "I am not going to write off the jobs of thousands of Australians by walking away from traditional industries," Morrison told the Seven Network, in one of several morning interviews rejecting calls for further action. "What we won't do is engage in reckless and job-destroying and economy-crunching targets which are being sought," he told Channel 9, responding to calls for more climate-friendly policies. Morrison's media blitz came as he sought to limit the political fallout from a much-criticised Hawaiian holiday - taken as bushfires destroyed an area the size of Belgium and unleashed toxic smoke into Australia's major cities. Holiday plans have been hit, with national parks closing camp sites and the main coastal road linking Sydney with southeastern beach towns again shuttered due to the impact of fires. Conditions eased markedly on Monday, but authorities said in the last few days almost 200 homes have been damaged by fires in South Australia and New South Wales. Authorities said little was left of the small town of Balmoral, southwest of Sydney, where 67-year-old artist Steve Harrison told public broadcaster ABC he had been forced to weather the fire from a make-shift kiln. "I ran to my ute (pickup) but my garden was already on fire, the driveway was on fire, the road was on fire so I couldn't evacuate," he said. "The day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back - a coffin-sized kiln - just big enough for me to crawl inside." "I was in there for half an hour while the firestorm went over. It was huge, just glowing orange-red everywhere. Just scary. I was terrified." A Big Bash League cricket match in the capital Canberra was abandoned at the weekend because of toxic bushfire haze that left Australian Test bowler Peter Siddle needing treatment for smoke inhalation. Adelaide Strikers captain Alex Carey said a doctor assessed Siddle and a couple of others. Siddle returned to Melbourne "and (is) joining the Australian squad" for a Boxing Day Test against New Zealand, Carey said. 'RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT' Bushfires occur frequently in Australia, but scientists say several weather phenomena have come together to make this spring-summer bushfire season among the worst on record. Record-low rainfall, record-high temperatures and strong winds have made the situation more combustible, and according to scientists, are influenced by climate change. Morrison has insisted Australia will meet its 2030 emissions targets. "I'm going to maintain the course of responsible management, responsibly addressing the changes of climate change and responsibly ensuring that we can grow our economy in what is a very tough climate at the moment," Morrison told the Seven Network. Australia committed at the 2015 UN climate summit to reduce its emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. However, environmental activists say those targets are not nearly enough to help the world keep global warming at safe levels. Morrison's government has further been criticised for seeking to achieve its 2030 targets by counting credits under a complicated global accounting method, rather than through new reductions. While Australia's national carbon emissions are low compared with major polluters, its fossil fuel exports - mostly coal - account for an estimated seven percent of the world's carbon emissions. The opposition leader, Labour's Anthony Albanese, pilloried Morrison's "stubbornness" in refusing "to change course." "People are scared of what is going on around them. And if Mr Morrison thinks that there's nothing to see here, it's because he can't see through the smoke and haze that's been created by these bushfires," Albanese said."
Climate change, floods and drought: Here’s how badly Singapore could be affected=21 Dec 2019 06:45AM (Updated: 03 Jan 2020 05:57PM)=CNA/dp=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/how-badly-climate-change-floods-drought-could-affect-singapore-12202206=" SINGAPORE: The official projection, by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore, is that the country could experience a mean sea level rise of up to a metre by 2100. But climate scientist Benjamin Horton thinks Singapore, of all places, should be worried because it could get higher. “What about a high emission (scenario)?” questions the professor at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment. “We’re looking at a full 1.5 metres for Singapore … That’s our best estimate.” To protect residents and infrastructure, he says Singapore must look at an even higher number. “You’d want to know what the extremes are … what the one-in-20 possibility is. We’re looking at greater than 2.5 metres.” The implication is that inland areas as far as Bishan and Toa Payoh could be at risk.   That is how badly climate change could affect the island, even as the government prepares to spend probably S$100 billion over the coming decades to protect Singapore. And as the programme Why It Matters finds out, Singaporeans might see the effects of the climate crisis sooner than they think. (Watch it here.) TIP OF THE ICEBERG The present-day sea level rise of 3.2 millimetres a year is “the fastest … we’ve seen for around six or seven thousand years”, notes Horton. And that does not add up to only six centimetres over the next 20 years. “What you want to think about is totalling that … with an acceleration,” he says. “For Singapore, in the next 20 to 30 years, we’ll get about 20 to 30 cm of sea level rise.” WATCH: Singapore in deep water: A flooded future (3:51)  Singapore is a “hot spot” because the effects of the melting ice at the poles are “amplified in the tropics”. “These ice sheets are massive. Anything that has mass has attraction to it … (As) the ice sheets lose mass, that attraction is diminished and the water flows away,” he points out. “And it goes back to the tropics.” Greenland, if it were all to melt, would raise global sea levels by six metres, while Antarctica has enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 times that. “And all our observations of Antarctica and Greenland are indicating that we’re approaching a tipping point,” he adds.   PERFECT STORM Singapore’s rainfall trend is already enough to cause concern, reckons senior research scientist Muhammad Eeqmal Hassim from the Meteorological Service Singapore. Annual rainfall has trended upwards at a rate of 9 mm per decade from 1980 to last year. “Nine millimetres doesn’t seem a lot, but … we’ve seen an upward trend in terms of the intensity and also the frequency. So heavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent and more severe,” he says. “When it rains, it pours.” He notes that heavy rainfall occurring over a short period is a “key ingredient” for a flash flood, “so with climate change, we can expect more of these events”. Adam Switzer, a principal investigator for NTU’s Earth Observatory of Singapore, is inclined to agree that there is an increased likelihood of inland flooding, especially if such rainfall events coincide with a storm surge.   A storm surge occurs when low atmospheric pressure causes a swell in the ocean and wind blows the water mass against the coastline — which means a “temporary elevation of sea level”. “So we’ll see … up to 30, 40 cm over several hours, moving through the Singapore Strait,” says the associate professor. “You have a baseline of rising sea level, but on top of that, you have these temporary storm surges. This is where you get to the perfect storm.” How often Singapore will experience these perfect storms, however, is a question mark, he acknowledges. “In Southeast Asia in particular, the data gap is so significant that it’s hard to put solid numbers on where we’re going to be in 2050 or 2100.”   EVALUATING THE COSTS NTU’s head of economics, Euston Quah, says “proper data” is also needed to measure, in dollar terms, the damage flooding could cause. Between 2000 and 2015, economic damages from floods were estimated to have exceeded S$32 million. Just the floods in June to July 2010 had cost S$23 million, from 868 insurance claims for business interruptions, property damage and motor vehicle damage. But there is more to measuring damages than that, says the professor of environmental economics. There is a cost to health, including treatment delays caused by traffic congestion; productivity loss is another aspect, for example if people cannot get to work or goods cannot be delivered; and there is lost tourism. Any loss of life must also be factored in, Quah points out, citing a study he and a colleague did in which the valuation of a person’s life here was S$4 million.   There are also intangible costs, such as loss of reputation, lost recreation and the psychological impact on people. “All of these feed back to the economy,” he adds. This is why Singapore is spending S$400 million upgrading and maintaining drains in the next two years, on top of the S$1.8 billion spent since 2011. But care must be taken not to overspend, says Quah, an expert in cost-benefit analysis. “If the cost of damages is S$10 million, (and) let’s say the cost of (the control measures) is S$12 million, then it makes no sense.” He calls for a “more detailed study” of the two costs so that a “better decision” on spending can be made.   RISK TO WATER SUPPLY Political and business leaders must also understand the scale of the “missing risks” in climate change, according to a recent joint report by the London School of Economics, the Columbia University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Economic assessments of the potential future risks … have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods because these risks are difficult to quantify precisely and lie outside of human experience,” the report states. One obvious scenario, however, is that a warmer climate means more droughts, so the reservoirs here and in Malaysia will be less than reliable. NEWater and desalinated water can close the gap, but they cost more. Their production requires between five and 17 times more energy, compared with the treatment of rainwater. These two water sources will also be affected by climate change, points out Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder.   “If we don’t have enough fresh water to begin with, we can’t recycle what we don’t have,” says the NTU professor. Seawater is not a simple solution either, as the warming of the oceans increases the amount of plankton such as algae. Most planktonic organisms, which drift in water, are microscopic. But in the right heat and light conditions, they can multiply and create blooms that are visible even from space. And scientists predict that climate change could make blooms more frequent. “We could have a decrease in the quality of the water,” says Snyder, who has focused on water issues for two decades and is a member of the World Health Organisation’s Drinking Water Advisory Panel.   “In Singapore, we rely primarily on membrane technology that separates the salt from the fresh water … So essentially, the increasing plankton in the ocean is more than the current filters were designed to handle," he adds. “They can still filter the water, but they can’t filter as much water. So it lowers production, and it makes the entire system less efficient.” Watch the episode here. Why It Matters is telecast every Monday at 9pm."
Air pollution cuts lead quickly to large health benefits=20 Dec 2019 05:31AM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/air-pollution-cuts-lead-quickly-to-large-health-benefits-12198804=" (Reuters Health) - Reducing air pollution at its source can substantially improve health within a few weeks, and the savings from reduced death and disease exceed the costs, according to a review of existing research. The authors looked at evidence of reduced deaths and disability from heart and respiratory disease and other illnesses at the individual and population levels within days or weeks of measures to reduce small-particle air pollution. The most dramatic health improvements occurred in regions with high air pollution that reduced their total output, but even small areas that decreased air pollution slightly saw improvements, the study authors report in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society. "Air pollution is a major risk factor for health in all organs of your body, and everyone needs to be aware that air pollution has real consequences," said Dr. Dean Schraufnagel of the University of Illinois at Chicago, the study's lead author. "At the same time, air pollution is an avoidable health risk," he told Reuters Health by phone. "Reducing it can result in prompt and substantial health gains and improve climate change as well." Schraufnagel and colleagues at the Forum of International Respiratory Societies reviewed case studies where health improved after pollution was reduced, even if only for a short period of time, such as temporary restrictions around Olympic games. They focused on several questions, including how quickly health changes, how much it improves, whether international standards must be met to see health differences and whether national and international air quality standards are good enough to reduce disease related to air pollution. Overall, the team found that respiratory and irritation symptoms like coughing, sore throat, phlegm and shortness of breath improved within a few weeks after a reduction in pollution output from sources such as a steel mill, or pollution-reduction measures during the 1996 and 2008 Olympics. In addition, fewer children were absent from school or went to emergency rooms with severe asthma, and doctors saw fewer hospitalizations, clinic visits, premature births, heart attacks and deaths overall. In particular, bans on smoking in public areas reduced deaths overall, especially from heart and lung diseases. Ireland's national smoking ban in 2004, for instance, reduced heart attacks and childhood asthma attacks. "The decrease in death and major diseases surprised me, but once you think about it, it makes sense because someone with heart disease could come in contact with smoke or fine particles in the air and have more stress on their body," Schraufnagel said. "Policymakers and the public need to know how important this is." Reducing household air pollution is important as well, he added. Switching to cleaner fuel, upgrading stoves and using household air filters significantly reduce health issues, the study authors found, including headaches, high blood pressure and asthma. Specifically, electric high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers decreased exposure to allergens and particles inside homes. On the largest scale, the authors cite the U.S. Clean Air Act as one of the most successful public health laws of all time, noting that it returned monetary benefits 32-fold greater than the costs of cutting pollution, according to a calculation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The savings came from reduced premature deaths, including 200,000 fewer heart attacks per year, and 66,000 fewer hospital admissions for respiratory disease per year. Although air pollution affects everyone, the study authors point out, the most vulnerable groups face higher risks, including children, the elderly, people with chronic diseases and the poor. Urban growth, industrialization and global warming contribute to these factors, which raises the degree of urgency for pollution control. "To reduce air pollution and limit climate change, we need a rapid transition to a cleaner and renewable energy system coupled with increases in energy efficiency," said William Fisk of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Indoor Environment Group in Berkeley, California, who wasn't involved in the review. "Get informed. With knowledge, individuals can reduce their air pollution exposures, particularly their indoor exposures, which often dominate," he told Reuters Health by email. "The collective action of individuals is essential to reduce future air pollution and climate change."

Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney=19 Dec 2019 07:19AM (Updated: 19 Dec 2019 04:45PM)=AFP/Reuters/hs/hm=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-nsw-declares-emergency-wildfires-approach-sydney-12195594=" SYDNEY: Australian authorities declared a seven-day state of emergency in New South Wales state Thursday (Dec 19) as a record heat wave fanned unprecedented bushfires raging across the region. As thousands of firefighters battled blazes, temperatures neared 50 degrees Celsius in some places and authorities warned the extreme weather conditions could get even worse. In New South Wales, Australia's most populated state with Sydney as its capital, more than 100 bushfires were burning on Thursday, many of them out of control. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the state of emergency, the second declared in the state since an early, drought-fueled bushfire season began in September, was due to "catastrophic weather conditions". Australia on Wednesday broke all-time heat records for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Narramore said the "dangerous and disastrous" heatwave was toppling dozens of "extraordinary" records across the country. "We're heading into a fifth or sixth day in a row where multiple places broke a record. And we're likely to see 30 or 40 records around the country break," he told the ABC. Turbulent winds of up to 100km in the afternoon were expected to fan bushfires burning ever-closer to the city. Authorities said nearly 120 fires remained ablaze by late afternoon, more than half of which are uncontrolled, and with temperatures forecast to top 45 Celsius in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert.   In Shoalhaven, a popular coastal destination some 190km south of Sydney, local mayor Amanda Findley said people were poised to evacuate. "There is a large amount of smoke looming over the city, which shows how close the fire is," Findley told Reuters by telephone. "It is extremely hot and windy now so we are all worried the fire could spread. People are really worried that they may lose everything." The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, which is home to more than 7 million people. "STRIKE TEAMS" ON STANDBY There are 2,000 firefighters battling the blazes with the support of US and Canadian teams, as well as Australia Defence Force personnel.   New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said five 100-person "strike teams" were on standby to deploy to the most dangerous fires. "The worst of the fire weather conditions, the extreme fire danger ratings we are expecting today, are centred around the greater Sydney environment," he added. Fitzsimmons said some firefighters had been left "shattered" after losing their own homes while saving other properties. "They and their families and colleagues are truly devastated by the loss," he said. "It will be another very emotional, very draining day for our firefighters." SMOKY SYDNEY The extreme weather is also causing major health concerns, with leading doctors this week labelling the smoke haze that has shrouded Sydney for weeks a "public health emergency". Hospitals have been recording large increases in emergency room visits for respiratory problems, including a dramatic 80 per cent spike when air quality plummeted on Dec 10. The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday. The major fires around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people, have resulted in days of heavy pollution in the city usually known for its sparkling harbour and blue skies. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city's southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people. By late afternoon, Sydney was sitting at No. 4 on the IQAir AirVisual live rankings of pollution in global cities, above Dhaka, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city. More than 70 fires are also raging across Queensland state to the north of NSW, including one at Peregian, near the coastal tourist hub of Noosa, that forced people to flee their homes Wednesday. Bushfires are also burning in South Australia and Western Australia.   At least three million hectares of land has been torched across Australia in recent months, with six people killed and more than 800 homes destroyed. POLITICAL STORM Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies. As local media reported Morrison was in Hawaii on a family holiday, about 500 protestors gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison's office refused to confirm his whereabouts. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, "ScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?" referencing the leader's nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive. Australia's low-lying Pacific neighbours have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation's climate policies following modest progress at the UN climate talks in Madrid. "It was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze," Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday. Scientists say the blazes have come earlier and with more intensity than usual due to global warming and a prolonged drought that has left the land tinder dry and many towns running out of water."
Commentary: Our holiday extravaganza has a huge carbon footprint=19 Dec 2019 06:09AM (Updated: 19 Dec 2019 06:10AM)=CNA/el(sl)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/holiday-christmas-gift-give-present-carbon-footprint-environment-12193502=" SINGAPORE: The climate crisis is on our minds, now that the Madrid United Nations conference came up short. With a host of holidays on our doorstep, how can we enjoy the holidays and still do our fair share to address global heating? Let’s start with one of the best parts of the holidays: Presents. With online shopping platforms like Lazada, AliExpress and Shopee, it has become even easier to experience the joy of giving. But will the recipient like our gift? “If they don’t like the gift, they (or we) can always send it back,” we might tell ourselves. However, one reverse logistics company Optoro estimates that 2.5 billion kg of returned gifts received by retailers end up in the rubbish. GIVE YOUR TIME Instead of buying new products, there are so many low-carbon gift-giving choices, if only we bothered to look. What about offering to enjoy an experience with gift recipients, such as a chance to play their favourite card or board game with us or to go with us to watch one of our many excellent local theatre companies? In this hectic world, a gift of our time may be the best most valued present of all. If we do want to buy something, here are some climate-friendly ideas. About 500 billion single-use plastic cups are used annually. That makes eco-friendly, reusable cups a gift that keeps on giving, and these cups come in an assortment of stylish colours and designs. Plus, places such as Starbucks offer discounts to customers who bring their own cups.   Thrift shops, such as those run by charities, including Salvation Army and MINDS, have pre-loved items looking for a new home, and the gift recipients will appreciate you thought so highly of them to believe they would appreciate a reused gift rather than worry their ego would be bruised unless they received something new. SAY NO TO WRAPPING PAPER After we’ve chosen or made a gift, we need to wrap it. In the UK alone, an estimated 50,000 carbon dioxide absorbing trees are chopped down for wrapping paper during the holiday season. The old standby for green wrapping paper is to use old newspaper. To spice up this type of gift wrapping, add fallen leaves or other nature items. Another alternative is to use a second present as the wrapping by putting presents inside towels, scarves, other clothing, and jars found at thrift shops. Yet another alternative is to use no wrapping at all. Instead, organise a scavenger hunt by hiding the unwrapped presents with the recipients’ names on them and letting everyone search for their own and others’ presents. DON’T FLY Many people like to travel for the holidays. Reduced air travel is another area in which combating the climate crisis can open our eyes to alternative ways to enjoy holiday time together. Rather than hopping on a plane and enduring long journeys in cramped cabins and long queues at customs to holiday in Iceland, South Africa or Korea, we can board a boat and in almost no time be enjoying nature, visiting a spa and tasting local delicacies in Batam and Bintan. Or, even easier and quicker, we can try a staycation. About two-thirds of Singaporeans have staycationed at least once and demand for staycations has risen 15 per cent recently.   Sometimes, the happiest and most surprising discoveries lie right in our backyards, not far away on the other side of the world. For example, how many of us have checked out the many Singapore heritage trails, such as the new one in Kallang, or tried the guided walks offered by NParks, VegThisCity and other providers? Hundreds of local Meetup groups and local media have pages listing the huge variety of cultural, recreational and educational events available in Singapore, some of which are free of charge. Here in Singapore we have easy access to a rainbow of cultures, from our local multiracial, multireligious society to the cosmopolitan array of peoples working and visiting here. We can expand our horizons without boarding a climate-warming airplane by stepping outside our comfort zones and meeting people different from ourselves here in Singapore. For example, many charities, such as the Singapore Children’s Society and ACRES, welcome volunteers. The connection goes so much deeper and can be so much more fulfilling when we volunteer at home, because the relationship is not hello-and-goodbye; it can be ongoing, with all the travelling done in only a matter of minutes on public transport. HIT PAUSE ON FASHION Fashion presents more opportunities to respond to the climate crisis, while reveling in being unique in our holiday best.   With the advent of fast fashion – inexpensive clothing produced quickly to respond to the latest fashion trends – we are now buying and discarding more clothing more quickly. A 2017 report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicted that by 2050, the world’s fashion industry could account for more than a fifth of our species’ carbon footprint. It is ironic that while it is fashionable to walk around with intentional holes and tears in our jeans, at the same time, we feel we must throw away other items of clothing at the first sign of wear-and-tear. Maybe we can start a new fashion trend using our Instagram and other social media. Let’s share pics of us wearing our shirts longer. For example, even when a shirt collar begins to fray, we can savour its familiar look and comfortable feel for another year or more. Plus, we can find colourful ways to do patches and other coverups, for example, by frequenting the local tailor and alteration shops found at wet markets. RETHINK EATING MEAT Last but not least, the centerpiece of many families’ holidays is the food. Here again, we can do our share to protect the earth for our younger generations to enjoy by tweaking the foods we enjoy so much. Animal agriculture – using animals for food – has produced more CO2 emissions than the entire global transportation sector over the last 100 years.   Fortunately, we can increase our consumption of plant-based foods and, in the process, discovery a wide variety of new foods and flavours, using spices – curry, chili, ginger, cumin, and more – with tofu, tempeh, lentils and other alternatives to meat, eggs and dairy. Many Singapore entrepreneurs are already engaged in recreating our favourite foods in climate-friendly ways. For instance, Singapore startup TurtleTree Labs is developing cow’s milk without the cows. Another Singapore startup Karana makes plant-based meat from jackfruit. It’s great to have many new foods to try at restaurants and to experiment with in our own kitchens. Here is one more thing to celebrate for the holidays: The more recent Climate Change Public Perception Survey by the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) found that more people are now ready to make changes in response to the climate crisis. In that spirit, let’s ring in 2020 and the Year of the Rat with progress towards a low-carbon future. Dr George Jacobs is the outgoing president of the Centre for a Responsible Future."
Commentary: How melting glaciers affect Indonesia – it's not just rising sea levels=18 Dec 2019 06:09AM (Updated: 18 Dec 2019 06:10AM)=CNA/el=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/indonesia-glacier-melt-ipcc-un-ocean-sea-climate-change-marine-12182294=" JAKARTA: Scientists, politicians and the people of Iceland recently placed a plaque mourning the loss of Okjokull glacier. Okjokull is no longer a living glacier because there has been insufficient ice build-up over the years to expand its glacial mass. The plaque acknowledges what is happening and what needs to be done in the next 200 years, because all of Iceland’s main glaciers are expected to suffer the same fate. INDONESIA’S GLACIERS Indonesia has glaciers on the Jayawijaya Mountains in Papua. The ice-covered peaks have lost 84.9 per cent of their glacial surface since 1988. A study has predicted the remaining glacial area will disappear within ten years. More alarming for Indonesia, climate change threatens not only its glaciers but also its vast seas, which make up around 70 per cent of the country’s area and are much deeper than the height of Jayawijaya Mountains. A panel of climate scientists under the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The report explains the latest understanding of our changing oceans and cryosphere (the cryosphere refers to the components of the Earth that are frozen). How are the SROCC’s findings relevant to Indonesia? CHANGING OCEANS Scientific findings have revealed the melting of the cryosphere that leads to global sea-level rise is just one of climate change’s many domino effects.   The report underlines that climate change causes the oceans to become warmer and more acidic and to lose oxygen persistently. Sea level rise that may submerge small islands happens not only continuously but is also accelerating. Extreme climate phenomena such as marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent, intense and long-lasting, particularly in the tropics. The same is true of extreme El Nino–Southern Oscillation events, which cause droughts and floods in Indonesia. THE STRAIN ON MARINE ECOSYSTEMS SROCC contains several important warnings about climate change’s impact on Indonesia as a tropical, archipelagic country. First, marine biodiversity is at risk. Climate change causes shifts in seasonal rhythms and the geographical ranges of marine species. Since the 1950s, marine species living in the upper 200m of the sea have been shifting poleward at about 52 km per decade. A similar pattern is happening to seafloor ecosystems. Considering the high biodiversity of marine species in Indonesia, further research is needed on changes in seasonal rhythms and geographical distributions of marine species in Indonesia. Second, the report highlights coral reefs as the most sensitive key marine ecosystem compared to seagrass and mangrove ecosystems that are also prevalent in Indonesia.   As host to the largest seagrass ecosystems in Southeast Asia and 23 per cent of total mangrove forests in the world, this finding is important for Indonesia. Reduced seagrass and mangrove ecosystems may lower the capacity of coastal ecosystems to absorb carbon emissions. Third, ocean warming reduces Indonesia’s maximum sea catch potential by up to 30 per cent if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising throughout the 21st century. This adds to the burden on a fisheries sector already plagued by overfishing. Combined effects of warmer and more acidic waters also have negative consequences for fish stocks and calcareous marine organisms (such as pearl oysters and lobsters). DON’T BLAME EVERYTHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE To formulate effective adaptation strategies, we need to understand the interactions of environmental degradation that occurs not only because of climate change. A classic example is the problem of the rising sea level in Jakarta – it is primarily driven by land subsidence due to groundwater extraction. The UN report also makes a distinction between ocean and coastal acidification. Ocean acidification refers to the increase of hydrogen ions in ocean waters due to reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and seawaters. However, Indonesian seas also experience coastal acidification due to local activities such as waste and pollution that further acidify seawater.   Local solutions that could regulate the ambient seawater acidity may reduce the impact of ocean and coastal acidification on the local community. These include effective waste management and conservation of seagrass ecosystems. SROCC AND CLIMATE NEGOTIATION SROCC is an important scientific input for climate negotiation at the United Nationals Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Spain. As a maritime nation, Indonesia plays an important role in taking concrete and realistic actions on climate change. SROCC shows the benefits of employing ambitious and effective climate adaptation strategies, such as protecting coastal communities, particularly those with large populations, from rising sea level. This protection is in line with sustainable development. SROCC states that the ocean is largely a victim of climate change, while land is identified as the primary culprit as well as victim of climate change.   Warmer, more acidic and deoxygenated oceans have implications for Indonesia’s commitments to protect its biodiversity and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Climate change challenges our commitment to protect marine biodiversity, the capacity of coastal ecosystems to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and the sustainable use of marine resources. Scientific findings from the SROCC and other UN publications should create momentum to take action that is inclusive and beyond business as usual. Such efforts will be appreciated by future generations. Intan Suci Nurhati is a scientist at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). This article first appeared on the Conversation. "
Goldman Sachs' green goal: US$750 billion in work for environmental projects by 2030=17 Dec 2019 08:21AM (Updated: 17 Dec 2019 10:10AM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/goldman-sachs--green-goal--us-750-billion-in-work-for-environmental-projects-by-2030-12189236=" NEW YORK: Goldman Sachs said on Monday it will provide US$750 billion in financing, advisory services and investments for green projects and companies, as well as those that foster economic opportunities for under-served people over the next decade. The bank sees "a powerful business and investing case" for working with companies that are taking steps to address climate change and inclusive growth, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon wrote in an editorial in the Financial Times announcing the goal. Goldman's moves, which also included ruling out any new loans for Arctic drilling or thermal coal mines, came just as the United Nations concludes a conference that failed to ramp up efforts to combat global warming. The US$750 billion figure is essentially the dollar amount that Goldman estimates it can generate in providing banking services and investment to companies and projects that are focused on renewable energy, sustainable transportation, affordable education and several other areas. On a call with reporters, Goldman executives said those banking services would include dealmaking, private equity-type investing and providing loans, but they declined to break down the top-line figure because it is dependent on market forces, they said. One example of work the bank believes it can replicate to meet this goal is a bond offering Goldman handled for Italian electricity company Enel earlier this year. Enel raised US$1.5 billion through a bond offering that linked the investments to its commitment to increase its renewable energy base by 25 per cent before 2022. The executives said the bank will not lose any significant amount of revenue as a result of the US$750 billion target or the internal ban on financing certain drilling and coal activities. The bank has not financed any projects that would fall afoul of that ban in recent memory, one executive said, in part because Goldman's due-diligence process takes into consideration and often rules out deals if they impact endangered species and indigenous populations."
Under fire over climate summit, Chile blames big polluters=17 Dec 2019 07:04AM=Reuters/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/under-fire-over-climate-summit--chile-blames-big-polluters-12189098=" SANTIAGO: Chile defended itself on Monday (Dec 16) against criticism it was too weak in presiding over international climate change negotiations, saying it did all it could but that four big polluting countries got in the way. Chilean President Sebastien Pinera described as "insufficient" the agreements reached on Sunday after marathon talks, but said it was not for the host’s lack of trying and criticism of its role was unfair. "You have to convince 195 countries, and so if just one opposes, there is no agreement," Pinera said in comments to local media. When it came to rules governing carbon markets, he said: "The four big countries didn't accept the proposals." Pinera said he personally lobbied other presidents to reach a deal, but would not identify who he called and did not name the countries which he said blocked the deal. "The countries that pollute the most did not live up to the challenge and remain in debt," he said in a subsequent tweet. Diplomats have listed the Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United States among those resisting bolder action. Chile had stepped in to preside over the talks after Brazil pulled out following the election victory of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. It was then forced to host them more than 10,000 kilometres away in Spain due to unrest at home. Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt, president of the UN summit known as COP25, came under fire on Saturday for circulating a draft text that campaigners said threatened to undermine the landmark 2015 Paris agreement on carbon reduction. "If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day," David Waskow of the World Resources Institute, said in the cavernous venue at the time. Greenpeace International said the Chileans were being "irresponsibly weak". Pinera said it was not fair to blame her. "She did all that was humanly possible," he said. By extending the talks, Schmidt salvaged a face-saving compromise text during late-night discussions. It cited the "urgent need" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement to avert catastrophic global warming. FUTURE CHALLENGES Schmidt said she was "sad and pained" at how nations had failed to find consensus but that the issue of carbon markets - a key sticking point - had tied down the last four summits. "Neither the will nor the political maturity yet exists from some of the big emitting countries to be able to reach agreement on this," she told a news conference. Laurence Tubiana, Chief Executive Officer of European Climate Foundation, said to win commitments more in line with the warnings of climate science the next host would need to build broad alliances and force those blocking progress to explain themselves openly. "It means deploying an intensive diplomatic effort right now," she said. Britain will preside over the next summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November 2020. Challenges include Brazil's insistence on a carbon accounting approach others say is baffling and Australia's insistence on carrying over old credits to meet its Paris emissions targets, which others see as an accounting trick. Brazil and developing countries, in turn, accused the European Union and other industrialized economies of stymieing progress on financial aid for poorer countries, saying they could not be more ambitious on their climate goals unless they received more assistance. Chile did manage to coax some governments into joining a new Ambition Alliance of mostly small countries, cities and businesses committed to slashing emissions. But the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations felt marginalized as Chile tried to force deadlocked major players into a compromise. Belize's Carlos Fuller, who represented small island states, told Reuters he was forced to assert himself by striding into a side-gathering of delegates from the United States, Brazil and European Union so they would be sure to see him. "We should have been invited into that room," he said."
Commentary: The spectacular failure of the Madrid climate talks=17 Dec 2019 06:18AM (Updated: 17 Dec 2019 08:29AM)=CNA/el (ml)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/cop25-un-madrid-climate-talks-fail-paris-agreement-carbon-market-12187652=" MELBOURNE: The United Nations’ COP25 climate talks concluded on Sunday (Dec 15) morning in Madrid, almost 40 hours overtime. After two weeks of protracted talks meant to address the planetary warming emergency, world leaders spectacularly failed to reach any real outcomes. The degree to which wealthy nations, including Australia, blocked progress on critical points of debate incensed both observers and country delegates. These points included robust rules for the global trading of carbon credits, increased commitments for finance to help developing nations tackle climate change, and most importantly, raising ambition to a level consistent with averting catastrophic climate impacts. HIGH HOPES COP25 was a conference of “parties”, or nations, signed up to the Paris Agreement, which takes effect in 2021. I attended the conference as an observer. Emissions reduction targets of nations signed up to Paris put Earth on track for a 3.2 degrees Celsius temperature increase this century. However the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says warming must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the most devastating climate impacts. Much was riding on the outcome in Madrid. However, it failed to deliver. One of the key agenda items was Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, involving international carbon trading between nations.   The previous COP in Poland failed to reach consensus on these trading rules, and after this latest meeting, many contentious issues remained unresolved. These include: THE QUESTION OF KYOTO CREDITS Australia was pushing to allow use of Kyoto Protocol units, for which it drew scathing criticism from other nations, international media and observers. It plans to meet more than half its Paris target via this accounting loophole. Brazil, India, South Korea and China also want to carry over credits earned under the Clean Development Mechanism, a trading scheme under Kyoto. No consensus was reached. The negotiations for rules for carbon markets will now continue at COP26 in Glasgow next year, just weeks out from the Paris Agreement’s start date. The argument will not be easily resolved. Five of the last seven COP meetings failed to reach a decision on carbon market rules, indicating the extent of international divisions, and calling into question the disproportionate focus on carbon trading, given its limited ability to address climate change.   In Madrid, 31 nations signed up to the San Jose principles, seeking to ensure environmental integrity in carbon markets. Upholding these principles would mean emissions must go down, not up as a result of trading carbon. OTHER FAILURES The conference also discussed measures to strengthen the governance and finance arrangements of the Warsaw International Mechanism, a measure designed to compensate poor nations for climate damage. Little progress was made on mobilising finance from developed nations. The US, which will soon exit the Paris Agreement, played a key role in stymieing progress. It resisted efforts for broad governance arrangements, and pushed for language in the rulebook which would exclude high-emitting nations from liability for the loss and damage experienced by vulnerable countries under climate change. At Glasgow, all nations under Paris are required to submit new emissions reduction commitments. It was widely expected that the Madrid meeting would strongly urge nations to ensure these targets were more ambitious than the last. Instead, the final text only “reminds” parties to “communicate” their commitments in 2020. "CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY" When the COP finally closed on Sunday morning, the meeting had failed to reach consensus on increasing emissions reduction ambition to the level required. The results are disheartening. The world has let another chance slip by to tackle the climate crisis, and time is fast running out.   The implications of this were perhaps summed up best by the low-lying Pacific island state of Tuvalu, whose representative Ian Fry said of the outcome: "There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity." Kate Dooley is a research fellow at the Climate and Energy College, University of Melbourne.

Commentary: We call it climate change. It's more like a global health crisis=16 Dec 2019 06:15AM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:20AM)=Project Syndicate/sl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-global-warming-pollution-health-crisis-12184638=" GENEVA: The climate crisis is also a health crisis. The same emissions that cause global warming are also largely responsible for polluting the air we breathe, causing heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and infections, and affecting every organ in our bodies. Air pollution is the new tobacco, causing as many deaths as cigarettes do. And though it threatens us all, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and adults with weakened immune systems are the most at risk. OUR POOR ATTITUDES ABOUT AIR POLLUTION It is now common knowledge that smoking tobacco severely harms you and those around you. That is why the tobacco industry’s lobbying and advertising campaigns have been strictly regulated around the world. Globally, we have taken steps to safeguard existing health policies, and to force these companies to tell the truth: That their product kills. And yet, our reaction is very different when we learn that air pollution and fossil-fuel-driven climate change are just as deadly. Where are the policies to prevent the fossil-fuel industry from lobbying governments, or to end the US$370 billion in subsidies lavished on coal, oil, and gas companies every year? Why are we still paying for a product that is killing us? As with the world’s strong response to tobacco, ending harmful fossil-fuel use will require scaling up current policy interventions and social-mobilisation efforts. Fortunately, some multilateral financial organisations have already recognised the opportunity that such a change represents.   Just recently, the European Investment Bank announced that it would end all of its funding for unabated fossil-fuel projects, and use its position to funnel public and private capital toward renewable energy. LIFE OR DEATH The choice between phasing out fossil fuels and continuing on the current path is black and white – it is a matter of life or death. We either will decide to prevent 7 million premature deaths per year by cleaning up our air and providing people with clean energy sources, or we won’t. We either will decide to prevent 4 million childhood asthma cases per year from traffic fumes, or we won’t. In any case, the lifetime health of a child born today will be profoundly affected by the decisions we make about climate change now and in the years to come. That is why the World Health Organisation has made climate change a top institutional priority.   KEEPING CLIMATE ACTION HIGH ON THE AGENDA Climate change should be a priority for all businesses, governments, and multilateral organisations, too. Keeping the issue high on the agenda provides the necessary motivation to make difficult choices. By taking action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degree Celsius relative to the pre-industrial level, we would not only ensure that our planet remains hospitable for future generations; we could also save at least one million lives per year, according to WHO’s estimates. Moreover, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, eliminating air pollution would save the economy 4 per cent of GDP per year in averted healthcare costs. In China and India, reducing emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius would more than pay for itself when accounting for the attendant health benefits. Likewise, transforming our food and transportation systems would save still more lives, by providing healthier diets and encouraging more physical activity – all while cleaning the air and stabilising the climate.   The human right to a healthy life and a sustainable future is increasingly being enforced through legal systems, and officials that fail to uphold these rights are being held accountable. In France, for example, a court found that the government had failed to do enough to limit air pollution around Paris, and in Indonesia, Jakarta residents similarly took legal action against the government because of air pollution. PUSHING FOR ACTION At this year’s United Nations General Assembly, many governments answered the WHO’s call to achieve “air quality that is safe for citizens, and to align climate change and air pollution policies by 2030.” This represents an encouraging first step. Now, many of the countries with the heaviest health burden from air pollution need to phase out their highest-pollution energy sources. At WHO, we will continue to push for action on these issues, while collaborating with others who are doing the same. Like the pollution that causes it, climate change does not observe national borders; it does not save its effects just for those who pollute. On the contrary, inequality is a key feature of the climate crisis: Those least responsible for the problem – children, disadvantaged communities, and the Global South – must bear a disproportionate share of the health burden.   WHO’s new global survey shows that many countries are highly exposed, vulnerable, and unsupported in dealing with health risks from climate change and air pollution. It is clear that we need an international and just response to this increasing strain on public health. Future efforts must reflect the real costs of our fossil-fuel based economy and aid those most affected. To achieve this, we will need all signatories to the Paris climate accord to strengthen their national climate plans by 2020. Beyond that, we need to establish new, robust mechanisms for protecting the most vulnerable and helping communities adapt to the realities of climate change. Health must be at the heart of our Paris commitments. The pollution that is choking our air and warming our planet has been accumulating for generations. We cannot afford to take that long to fix the problem. Maria Neira is Director of the Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at the World Health Organisation."
UN chief calls climate summit a 'lost opportunity'=15 Dec 2019 10:46PM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:56AM)=AFP/aa/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/un-chief-calls-climate-summit-a-lost-opportunity-12185884=" MADRID: A major climate summit wrapped up in Madrid on Sunday (Dec 15) with a compromise deal that left little to show, prompting UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to lament a "lost opportunity" to act. Almost a fortnight of COP 25 talks just squeezed out hard-earned compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. "I am disappointed with the results of COP 25," Guterres said. "The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis." The summit's final declaration "expresses the urgent need" for new carbon cutting commitments to close the gap between current emissions and the Paris treaty goal of capping temperature at below two degrees Celsius, said host country Spain. "Today, the citizens of the world are asking for us to move ahead faster and better," Carolina Schmidt, Chilean environment minister and President of COP 25, told the closing plenary. But Tina Eonemto Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, denounced the response as inadequate for facing an existential threat of rising sea levels. "Unfortunately, the new text we adopted this morning does not reflect anything near what we would have wanted. It is the bare minimum and we regret that countries could not agree on a more ambitious text," Stege said. MAJOR PLAYERS 'DID NOT DELIVER' Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down. The summit - moved at the last minute from Chile due to unrest - at times teetered on the brink of collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests. Negotiators from nearly 200 nations came to Spain's capital with the aim of finalising the rulebook for the 2015 Paris accord, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature to below two degrees Celsius. "Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations," said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and, as France's top negotiator, a main architect of the Paris Agreement. "But thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters." Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro however blamed the rich nations. "I'd like to know: has there been a resolution for Europe to be reforested, or are they just going to keep bothering Brazil?" he said Sunday, speaking from his country. Bolsonaro has been widely criticised for easing restrictions on exploiting the Amazon's vast riches, leading to an acceleration in deforestation there. "MISSING IN ACTION" With the accord set to become operational next year, campaigners had hoped that protests, irrefutable science, and deadly storms and wildfires that marked 2019, would move governments to redouble their efforts at COP 25. But that greater ambition largely failed to materialise, leaving some veteran observers aghast. "Most of the world's biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition," said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a 28-year veteran of the climate process. The push for strengthening voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union. These have called out nations they see as blocking consensus - notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India, the world's No. 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030. These emerging giants chose instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. 'LOSS AND DAMAGE' The summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook. Instead, the focus now switches to next year's COP 26 in Glasgow, when the true Paris deadline falls. The US, which is leaving the Paris deal next year, was accused of playing spoiler on a number of issues. This included so-called "loss and damage" funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild. "The US has not come here in good faith," said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid. "They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change." Even if all countries implement their current plans under Paris, Earth is on course to warm more than 3C by 2100. Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg - named 2019 Person of the Year by Time magazine - on Friday slammed world leaders for "still trying to run away from their responsibilities" while demanding a "year of action" in 2020."
UN climate conference offered countries better understanding despite lack of overall consensus: Masagos=15 Dec 2019 10:14PM (Updated: 16 Dec 2019 06:44AM)=CNA/AFP/ga=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/masagos-zulkifli-climate-change-cop-25-united-nations-summit-12185804=" MADRID: The recently concluded United Nations climate summit in Madrid did not result in an overall consensus, but “we must not lose hope”, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said on Sunday (Dec 15). Despite the inconclusive summit, the discussions “offered countries a better understanding of one another’s positions”, he said in a Facebook post. “This places us in good stead as we work on moving forward.” The 12-day COP 25 summit sought to resolve issues in implementing the Paris Climate Accord. It ended with a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis. Mr Masagos co-facilitated the overarching decision texts for the conference, which were “successfully adopted”. “With this, we will keep the drive to address Climate Change alive and take up new areas of concern like the Ocean and its climate impact,” he said. The summit is “a reminder of the importance of support for multilateralism as a key framework, for diverse countries to jointly advocate common causes such as climate change, free trade and peace”, Mr Masagos added. He also expressed regret that one of the key deliverables, carbon markets, did not come through. “(Carbon markets) would enable countries and industries with deficit carbon credits to buy from countries that have an excess of them,” he said. “Countries with excess credits are usually those with green lungs and such a system would incentivise them to maintain them.” He added that this would also help fund vulnerable and developing countries to cope with the future impact of climate change. Last week, the minister reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming. Singapore had pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise its emissions with the aim of peaking around that year. “Let us not be defined by our differences, but our common objective of safeguarding our planet for future generations,” he said. “We will work with the incoming UK COP-26 Presidency to achieve a good outcome in Glasgow.”"
Facing climate emergency, UN summit staggers on=15 Dec 2019 05:53AM (Updated: 15 Dec 2019 06:00AM)=AFP/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/facing-climate-emergency-un-summit-staggers-on-12185094="  MADRID: A UN climate summit in Madrid was on life support Saturday (Dec 14) after marathon negotiations between countries left them more divided than ever over on how to fight global warming and pay for its ravages. Diplomats from rich nations, emerging giants and the world's poorest countries - each for their own reasons - found fault with a draft agreement put forward by host Chile in a botched attempt to strike common ground. Faced with fire-alarm warnings from science, deadly extreme weather made worse by climate change, and weekly strikes by millions of young people, negotiations in Madrid were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down in tackling the crisis. But the 12-day talks, more than 24 hours after their scheduled end, had retreated even further from this goal on Saturday. Simon Stiell, Grenada envoy, told AFP that the lack of ambition in the initial agreement text was "crazy". "It isn't reflective of the kids who are demonstrating on the streets the world over, communities being washed away by rising sea levels," he said late Saturday. "We wanted provisions that were in the Paris agreement to remain and what we see at every COP it just seems to be another opportunity to erode those." UNPRECEDENTED DISCONNECT Veteran observers of UN climate talks were stunned by the state of play nearly 24 hours after the negotiations had been due to close. "I have never seen such a disconnect between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, versus what the climate negotiations are delivering," Alden Meyer, strategy and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told AFP. Alexandria Villasenor, a 14-year-old climate activist, said she was "disappointed" in the lack of action at COP 25. "The difference between the youth on the streets and the negotiations is that the youth on the streets are acting with urgency," she told AFP. "COP 25 has failed us and it's another year of failure."   Under the Paris accord, countries agreed in 2015 to work to limit global temperature rises to "well below" two degrees Celsius through a series of voluntary action pledges that step up over time. The push for a strengthening of voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union. Ministers from this "high ambition coalition" have called out countries they see as blocking a consensus call for all countries to step up, notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India, the world's No 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, have made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030. These emerging giants have chosen instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. Observers told AFP Saturday evening that a possible landing ground had emerged in which China agreed to yield a little over language surrounding ambition in return for a clear reiteration of historic polluters' obligation to do more. The COP 25 summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook, which goes into effect next year. Some nations, notably Brazil and Australia, want to count carbon credits accumulated under a previous climate deal as part of their commitments under the Paris goals, further stymying progress. 'PEOPLE MUST RISE UP' The United States, which is leaving the landmark Paris climate deal next year, was accused of acting as a spoiler on a number of issues vital to climate-vulnerable nations. This included so-called "loss and damage" funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild. "The US has not come here in good faith," said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid. "They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change." Even if nations in Madrid snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and agree to implement their pledges, Earth is on course to warm more than 3 degree Celsius by 2100. "If there was one time in the history when I would say governments f***ed up, I would say today in Madrid, governments f***ed up," said Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa. "People across the world must rise to save the planet.""
Frustrated with climate talks, activists dump manure outside Madrid summit=15 Dec 2019 05:31AM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/frustrated-with-climate-talks--activists-dump-manure-outside-madrid-summit-12184908=" MADRID: Green activists dumped horse manure and staged a mock hanging outside the venue of a UN climate summit in Madrid on Saturday (Dec 14), airing their frustration at the failure of world leaders to take meaningful action against global warming. Led by grassroots group Extinction Rebellion, the actions were timed to coincide with the closing of the COP25 summit, where negotiators have been unable to agree on how to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. "Just like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic, this COP’s fiddling of carbon accounting and negotiating of Article 6 is not commensurate to the planetary emergency we face," Extinction Rebellion said in a statement. Twelve members of the group stood on melting blocks of ice, nooses drawn tight around their necks to symbolise the 12 months remaining until the next summit, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase. Attached to the pile of manure was a short message to leaders saying "the horseshit stops here." In contrast to a protest held last weekend, in which hundreds of demonstrators blocked one of Madrid's central shopping streets for a mass disco-dance, the mood at the gathering was subdued. "Even if they reach an agreement it's still not enough. This is the 25th COP they've had and nothing has really changed," protester Emma Deane told Reuters from her perch atop an ice block, holding her young daughter in her arms. "She's going to grow up in a world where there's no food on the shelves and that breaks my heart." Still, Extinction Rebellion spokesman Ronan McNern stressed the importance of humour in the face of the climate crisis. "Out of shit comes the best roses. We hope that the international community comes together to create a beautiful future," McNern said."
Fate of global climate action 'in the balance' as UN talks go down to wire=14 Dec 2019 09:28AM (Updated: 14 Dec 2019 09:34AM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/fate-of-global-climate-action--in-the-balance--as-un-talks-go-down-to-wire-12183180=" MADRID: Big polluting countries faced last-ditch pressure from smaller nations to show serious commitment to fighting climate change as negotiators battled into the early hours of Saturday (Dec 14) to salvage a result from a fraught UN summit in Madrid. With the two-week gathering mired in interlocking disputes over how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming, Chile, presiding over the talks, had earlier attempted to inject a note of optimism. "Today is the day when we must show the world that we are capable of delivering the agreements that are needed to tackle the unprecedented challenge before us," Andrés Landerretche, a Chilean official, told a news conference late on Friday. Chile later announced the talks, which had been due to end on Friday, would resume at 0700am (0600 GMT) on Saturday. Observers said delegates were struggling to resolve the question of whether big emitters will signal their intent to raise their emissions-cutting targets next year, when the Paris deal enters a make-or-break implementation phase. "The fate of the Paris Agreement is in the balance," said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based think tank. Fast-growing emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are reluctant to commit themselves to unveiling new goals so soon, observers say, fearing they will end up paying the price of emissions cuts that should be borne by the rich. The European Union, whose members, barring Poland, agreed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, is pushing for a more ambitious statement of intent, along with many of the most vulnerable developing countries. After two weeks of talks in Madrid, held after months of preparation, ministers were holed up in small groups attempting to break deadlocks over financial aid for states at most risk from climate change, and rules governing carbon markets. Progress on those issues would help deliver the bigger prize: A clear statement from the gathering that governments are committed to honouring the Paris deal by imminently announcing more ambitious action to wean themselves off fossil fuels. "There is a very big question on the commitment of the parties to the Paris Agreement," said Mohamed Nasr, chair of the Africa bloc of negotiators. "25 YEARS OF TALKS" With scientists warning that the window to prevent the Earth's climate hitting irreversible tipping points is fast closing, an increasingly strident activism movement says a strong signal from the summit is the only acceptable outcome. "We've had 25 years of talks and the only thing that really matters is global emissions are still rising," said Tim Crosland, a prominent member of Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign, after meeting officials at the talks. Campaigners are concerned that as negotiations dragged on into the early hours of Saturday, delegates may be tempted to hastily adopt weak resolutions to conclude the marathon. The talks have been overshadowed since the outset by a formal move by US President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing from the Paris accord last month. Observers said the US delegation repeated a pattern seen at past talks of blocking progress toward ensuring poor countries can secure compensation for climate-related losses. But the weight of negotiating effort focused on trying to persuade Australia, Brazil and others to drop their insistence on carrying over credits from old carbon trading schemes. The EU and small island states say that continuing to count such credits would dramatically weaken the fight to curb emissions. Brazil has also come under fire for opposing attempts to impose gold standard accounting rules on the carbon trade. "We don't want any accounting tricks being created here," said Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch, an advocacy group. "It would be a massive disaster ... if we end up with flawed and weak rules.""
Australia's climate stance sparks anger at UN summit=13 Dec 2019 11:45PM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/australia-climate-stance-anger-un-summit-12183202=" MADRID: Campaigners slammed Australia on the final day of a UN climate summit on Friday (Dec 13) as its policy of using old carbon credits to count towards future emissions targets emerged as a major sticking point in negotiations. The talks aim to agree outstanding details of how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid catastrophic global warming ahead of a crucial implementation phase next year, with carbon trading among the main outstanding issues. Australia wants to use carbon credits assigned to developed economies under the Kyoto Protocol, a precursor climate accord, to meet its greenhouse gas targets under the Paris accord. Britain, Germany, New Zealand and others have ruled out such an approach, saying it undermines the spirit of the Paris deal. Using the credits would allow Australia to appear to meet its commitments while taking essentially no new action to reduce emissions, said Richie Merzian, climate director at The Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think-tank. "There's bushfires that are ravaging Australia right now that are clearly linked to climate change and that are choking Australia's largest cities with all the smoke," Merzian told Reuters at the two-week negotiations in Madrid. "Instead of coming to Madrid to argue for more global action to address climate change, Australia is lobbying to do less," said Merzian, a former Australian government climate negotiator. As UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the world would be "doomed" unless big emitters step up commitments, Australia's energy minister Angus Taylor said targets alone cannot address climate change, no matter how ambitious. "We can only reduce emissions as fast as the deployment of commercially viable technology allows," Taylor told delegates. Costa Rica, Fiji and others have criticised Australia's stance. Fiji's economy minister Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum said he hoped to see some "rationality" from Australia: "At the moment, we have seen they are far from sitting at the same table." Australia's reliance on coal-fired power makes it one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita and in June it approved a huge new coal mine by India's Adani Enterprises. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government insists that Australia will meet a pledge to cut emissions by at least 26 per cent "at a canter" by 2030 versus 2005 levels. But independent analysts say that with emissions trending upwards, it looks unlikely that Australia will be able to achieve the target. On Tuesday, The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index rated Australia as one of the worst performers among 57 high-emitters, with it earning 0 out of 100 possible points for its policies."
'Moral call to rest of the world' on climate from hardest hit countries, Obama says=13 Dec 2019 05:24PM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/barack-obama-climate-change-moral-call-kuala-lumpur-12182442=" KUALA LUMPUR: Island nations and poor coastal countries facing the severest effects of climate change offer a "moral call to the rest of the world" to act now, former US President Barack Obama said on Friday (Dec 13). "For those of you who are ... experiencing the effects of it right now, there may be some hard questions in terms of adaptation versus mitigation," Obama said at a youth leaders conference in Malaysia's capital city of Kuala Lumpur, organised by the Obama Foundation. Island countries that could disappear due to rising sea levels had on Thursday accused rich nations of losing sight of the urgency of the crisis, as a UN summit enters the final stretch of negotiations for countries to honour the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. "Your voice, your witness to what's happening right here and now, is a moral call to the rest of the world. And figuring out how to tell the story of what you are seeing, and the losses that are already taking place, that's going to be important." The United States signed onto the 2015 Paris Agreement during Obama's presidency, promising a 26 to 28 per cent cut in emissions by 2025 from 2005 levels. But the administration of Obama's successor Donald Trump filed paperwork last week to withdraw from the pact. The Paris accord aims to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios foreseen by climate scientists by limiting the rise in average global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels. Once it exits, the United States - the top historic greenhouse gas emitter and leading oil and gas producer - will become the only country outside the accord. Obama said that it is up to the world's youth to lead the charge in dealing with climate change, blaming the previous generation for failing to handle the issue "the way it should have". "The oceans will be rising, and that is going to displace people. So we'll to have to anticipate and care for some of the consequences, including large scale migrations and disruptions. That's going to be very possible," Obama said. "Old people are not going to worry about this as much as young people because they're going to be gone when the full effects of this will come. So you're going to have more urgency and educate your communities.""
Commentary: Kelantan’s epic struggles with great, yellow floods each monsoon=13 Dec 2019 06:23AM (Updated: 13 Dec 2019 06:30AM)=CNA/el(sl)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/malaysia-flood-kelantan-terengganu-develop-poor-land-forest-mine-12179072=" SINGAPORE: Malaysia saw some of its worst floods in 2014 with Kelantan suffering the brunt of the damage. Some 202,000 people in the state were displaced and 13 died. Over three days, 1,295mm of rainfall was recorded in Gua Musang - the equivalent of 64 days of rain usually seen in the area. During the floods, Kelantan’s rivers had risen between 10 to 38m – a serious problem when the official danger point for these rivers’ rise is 9m. The inclement weather also severely affected the neighbouring states of Pahang and Terengganu. During the same season, many other areas in Malaysia – including Negeri Sembilan, Johor and Sabah - also suffered floods. Then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was on holiday in the US and elected not to declare a state of emergency upon his return. But that didn’t stop Malaysian civil society groups from getting swiftly into action to mobilise help for those stranded without food or clean water. Countless convoys of vans and trucks moved north, packed to the brim with supplies and equipment – a huge uncoordinated NGO and civilian effort that eventually complemented national disaster response teams. There were also generous foreign contributions of cash, manpower, equipment and emergency rations from Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, China and other concerned neighbours. PERENNIAL PROBLEM While the 2014 floods were the worst in Kelantan’s history, such floods have returned each year during the monsoon season. Significant floods were recorded in 1927 and 1967 in Kelantan. Every year since 2014, heavy rainfall coupled with high tides threaten the return of Bah Kuning (yellow flood) – named so by locals because of the food waters’ high mud content.   While the blame for recurring floods and severe storms usually falls on climate change, the reason for Kelantan’s woes are manifold. While climate change and global warming have led to more frequent extreme weather phenomena and intensive rainfall over short periods of time, which have the worst impact when tides are high, these issues only serve to enhance the problems peculiar to Kelantan. Kelantan is one of the least developed and poorest states in Malaysia. There are no gleaming cities of skyscrapers or urban amenities in the state. Instead, the state is isolated from the rest of the peninsula by the Titiwangsa Mountains; a range that encircles the Kelantan River basin – a fertile rice-bowl that has also historically supported rubber and tobacco plantations. HUGE LAND ASSETS Launched in 2006, the Kelantan People’s Farm programme set aside 600,000 ha of forest reserve for monocrop plantations. It has been argued that a poor state led by an opposition government has little choice but to raise money through the assets that it has. Kelantan's oil fields provide revenue to Petronas and the federal government. It has recently filed a lawsuit to claim unpaid oil royalties of about RM1 billion (US$240 million) that could improve infrastructure and alleviate poverty in the state. Kelantan is also blessed with land and forests. But today, much of the state’s forests, hills and mountains have been razed for oil palm, durian plantations and mining, depriving the state of natural flood prevention features.   Once land, plantation or mining licences are carved out and distributed, forests are logged – this is the first source of income for opportunistic businessmen. Primary forest timber is a goldmine. Thereafter, the land is stripped and sowed for planting, or dug into for its gold, manganese or iron ore – all of which either result in or require the use of toxic materials to extract desired minerals. ONE, TWO, THREE, MONSOON When the monsoon arrives, several things happen. One, hills bare from logging or mining are no longer able to absorb rainfall and everything slides off mud and clay slopes into the river basin. This is why Kelantan’s floodwaters are yellow. Two, felled logs stacked by the river banks to be barged to transportation points are sucked into floodwaters and subsequently block river mouths and exit points – forcing water levels to rise. Three, add to that a high tide, and waters rushing down from the hills are met with seawater heading upriver. All of Kelantan’s towns are located in its river basin, adjacent to the rivers that can both support and destroy its communities. Given that this has now become an annual occurrence, and since it is clear that logging has disastrous consequences on the state’s townships, why isn’t more done to tackle the scourge of flooding? THE POLITICS OF IT The Malaysian Meteorological Department is a highly professional entity that accurately predicts extraordinary rainfall and potential flooding well in advance – sending out evacuation warnings to both citizens and other agencies to prepare for adverse conditions. However, some citizens refuse to pay heed to these warnings and are highly reluctant to evacuate. At times bipartisan tensions prevent immediate and effective disaster response and mitigation.   During the 2014 floods, volunteers on the ground reported that some villagers refused assistance from certain political or religious groups. Some volunteers who travelled north to help also refused to distribute emergency rations and equipment to areas that were not of political interest to them. All of these artificially and politically-created divisions get in the way of effective disaster management and response. Kelantan has always been an opposition state, ruled by the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Distrust and other tensions between the state and the federal government hampers effective collaboration for both disaster relief and habitat conservation. WHOSE LINE IS IT? On top of that is the problem of lax local attitudes to waste management. Even during the dry season, when there are no rains to sweep rubbish from land into the rivers and seas, Kelantanese rivers nearest to the townships are already black from pollution and chock full of waste. There is little proper waste or sanitation systems in some parts of the state. Many citizens also choose to use the drains, streams and rivers as their rubbish bins. All of this waste clogs drainage systems. When a storm is factored in, waste and logs seal these systems shut – and water levels rise. In the Malaysian constitution, the federal government is responsible for issues of the environment; including matters of stewardship, conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.   However, jurisdiction over land, water, mining and forests remain with the state. This means that the federal government can only advise the state, but cannot force it to stop logging, mining or clearing hills. Because licences to mine, plant and log are lucrative sources of income, Kelantan does not seem to be inclined to put a stop to it. The only way that this situation can be improved or mitigated is for regulations in this area to change. Revisions to the Water Resources Act and the Environmental Quality Act have been discussed, but it is unclear whether revisions can be implemented as state governments will be reluctant to release control over vital sources of income. But Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin’s calls for the Malaysian government to be accorded with greater enforcement powers has gained traction since Johor water supplies were disrupted in March after a major pollution incident at Sungai Kim Kim. Jurisdictional overlaps remain at the heart of the problem. Until this is resolved, Kelantan citizens can only brace themselves for increasingly frequent floods, do what they can to protect their property and belongings, and pay heed to the orders to evacuate.

First commercial electric plane takes flight in Canada=12 Dec 2019 02:41AM (Updated: 12 Dec 2019 02:50AM)=AFP/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/first-commercial-electric-plane-takes-flight-in-canada-12177552=" VANCOUVER: The world's first fully electric commercial aircraft took its inaugural test flight on Tuesday (Dec 10), taking off from the Canadian city of Vancouver and offering hope that airlines may one day end their polluting emissions. "This proves that commercial aviation in all-electric form can work," said Roei Ganzarski, chief executive of Seattle-based engineering firm magniX. The company designed the plane's motor and worked in partnership with Harbour Air, which ferries half a million passengers a year between Vancouver, Whistler ski resort and nearby islands and coastal communities. Ganzarski said the technology would mean significant cost savings for airlines - not to mention zero emissions. "This signifies the start of the electric aviation age," he told reporters. Civil aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of carbon emissions as people increasingly take to the skies and new technologies have been slow to get off the ground. At 285 grammes of CO2 emitted per kilometre travelled by each passenger, airline industry emissions far exceed those from all other modes of transport, according to the European Environment Agency. The emissions contribute to global warming and climate change, which scientists say will unleash ever harsher droughts, superstorms, and sea-level rise. The e-plane - a 62-year-old, six-passenger DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver seaplane retrofitted with an electric motor - was piloted by Greg McDougall, founder and chief executive of Harbour Air. "For me that flight was just like flying a Beaver, but it was a Beaver on electric steroids. I actually had to back off on the power," he said. McDougall took the plane on a short loop along the Fraser River near Vancouver International Airport in front of around 100 onlookers soon after sunrise. ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY FLYING The flight lasted less than 15 minutes, according to an AFP journalist on the scene. "Our goal is to actually electrify the entire fleet. There's no reason not to," said McDougall. On top of fuel efficiency, the company would save millions in maintenance costs, as electric motors require "drastically" less upkeep, McDougall said. However, Harbour Air will have to wait at least two years before it can begin electrifying its fleet of more than 40 seaplanes. The e-plane has to be tested further to confirm it is reliable and safe. In addition, the electric motor must be approved and certified by regulators. In Ottawa, Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters ahead of the maiden flight that he had his "fingers crossed that the electric plane will work well." If it does, he said, "it could set a trend for more environmentally friendly flying." Battery power is also a challenge. An aircraft like the one flown on Tuesday could only fly about 160 kilometres on lithium battery power, said Ganzarski. While that's not far, it's sufficient for the majority of short-haul flights run by Harbour Air. "The range now is not where we'd love it to be, but it's enough to start the revolution," said Ganzarski, who predicts batteries and electric motors will eventually be developed to power longer flights. While the world waits, he said cheaper short-haul flights powered by electricity could transform the way people connect and where they work. "If people are willing to drive an hour to work, why not fly 15 minutes to work?" he said."
UN head demands bolder climate action or 'we are doomed'=11 Dec 2019 09:57PM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/un-antonio-guterres-demands-bolder-climate-action-12176720=" MADRID: UN chief Antonio Guterres exhorted major world economies on Wednesday (Dec 11) to signal more ambitious commitments to cut greenhouse emissions as climate talks in Madrid hit an intense phase. "We need to have the big emitters understanding that their role is essential, because if the big emitters fail, everything will fail," Guterres told Reuters in an interview. "If we just go on as we are, we are doomed." He was speaking in a hangar-like conference centre in Madrid where ministers from around the world are cloistered in the final days of two-week talks to shore up the 2015 Paris Agreement to avert catastrophic global warming. Major polluting countries such as China, India and the United States - which is leaving the pact - are not expected to make big new announcements at the summit, where delegates are focused on technical negotiations over rules on carbon markets. Nevertheless, Guterres hopes the talks will conclude on Friday with a strong signal that governments are ready to submit more ambitious climate plans in 2020, seen as a make-or-break year for the Paris process. Under the deal, countries are supposed to submit more stringent targets to cut carbon emissions in the run-up to the next annual round of talks in Glasgow. Scientists say that current pledges are nowhere near enough to stabilise the earth's climate in time to avert catastrophic sea-level rise, prevent severe damage to agriculture, and stop droughts and floods generating waves of forced mass migration. Guterres urged major emitters to send a clear signal they are ready to increase their ambition next year and "hopefully" commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - seen as vital to keeping global temperatures within manageable levels. "History cannot accept that my generation will betray our children and grandchildren," said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, who has made climate a signature issue since taking over as UN secretary-general in early 2017. Guterres welcomed moves by the European Union to adopt a new "European Green Deal" to transition to a low-carbon economy. Details of the policy were being unveiled in Brussels on Wednesday to coincide with the UN climate summit. "It is always essential that someone starts," Guterres said. "If Europe will do so, that I think will be a very important contribution for others to consider the same kind of commitment. If no-one starts, then there is no chance.""
Climate activist Greta Thunberg is Time's 2019 person of the year=11 Dec 2019 09:34PM (Updated: 12 Dec 2019 08:46AM)=AFP/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-time-2019-person-of-the-year-12176880=" NEW YORK: Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swede who inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change, has been named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. Thunberg launched a grassroots campaign at the age of 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside Swedish parliament, pushing for her government to meet its ambitious goals to curb carbon emissions. Her actions quickly captured people's imagination, and in September this year millions of people took to the streets in cities across the world to support her cause.   The magazine interviewed Thunberg aboard the sailboat that took her from the United States to Europe after a hectic 11-week North American trip to several US cities and Canada. "In the 16 months since (her protests began), she has addressed heads of state at the UN, met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike," the magazine said. "Margaret Atwood compared her to Joan of Arc. After noticing a hundredfold increase in its usage, lexicographers at Collins Dictionary named Thunberg’s pioneering idea, climate strike, the word of the year." It added: "The politics of climate action are as entrenched and complex as the phenomenon itself, and Thunberg has no magic solution." "But she has succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change. "She has offered a moral clarion call to those who are willing to act, and hurled shame on those who are not." Thunberg, who turns 17 in January, is currently in Madrid at a United Nations climate summit where world leaders are wrangling over how to implement a 2015 Paris agreement designed to avert potentially catastrophic global warming. She was typically blunt in her assessment of politicians' efforts. "It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition," she said on stage, drawing applause from an audience that included dozens of her supporters. "I'm sure that if people heard what was going on and what was said ... during these meetings, they would be outraged." Former US Vice President Al Gore, a longtime environmentalist, said the magazine made a "brilliant choice" in choosing the reluctant celebrity. "Greta embodies the moral authority of the youth activist movement demanding that we act immediately to solve the climate crisis. She is an inspiration to me and to people across the world," Gore said. Thunberg's stance on climate change has brought her into confrontation with some of the world's most powerful people. A video of her giving US President Donald Trump what media described as a "death stare" at a UN climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and has challenged every major US regulation aimed at combating climate change. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro this week called Thunberg a "brat" after she criticized mounting violence against indigenous people in which two Amazon tribesmen were shot dead. The activist retorted by changing the biographical description on her Twitter account to "Pirralha," the Portuguese word Bolsonaro used to insult her. Other nominees for Time's person of the year included Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."
Activist Thunberg denounces 'creative PR' in climate fight=11 Dec 2019 05:55PM (Updated: 11 Dec 2019 07:07PM)=Reuters/nr/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greta-thunberg-climate-change-united-nation-summit-12176234=" MADRID: Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at a United Nations summit on Wednesday (Dec 11). "It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition," the 16-year-old Swede told the meeting in Madrid, drawing applause. "I still believe the biggest danger is not inaction, the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR," she added. Politicians in Madrid are grappling with outstanding issues in the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to avert catastrophic global warming, including the spiny issue of accounting for carbon emissions. Many countries and companies are relying on the idea of carbon markets to meet goals to cut greenhouse gas output and help limit temperature rises to between 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Supporters of carbon markets say they can serve to lower the cost of reducing emissions and enable countries to commit to more ambitious targets. Others see them as a way to stall more aggressive action to cut emissions. Thunberg said many pledges to balance out emissions in this way did not include the impact of shipping, aviation and international trade, and called for quicker action. "Zero in 2050 means nothing if high emission continues even for a few years," said Thunberg, who has become a symbol of youth anger against older generations and the political classes for foot-dragging over the environmental crisis. "To stay below 1.5 degrees we need to keep the carbon in the ground.""
World's richest countries need to behave like adults in climate fight: John Kerry=10 Dec 2019 08:45PM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/world-richest-countries-climate-fight-john-kerry-12172940=" MADRID: The world's richest nations are failing to "behave like adults" and act firmly enough to meet global warming targets set in the Paris climate accord, former US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday (Dec 10). Kerry, who served as the top US diplomat under President Barack Obama and was a leading player in brokering the Paris Agreement in 2015, said the G20 nations are lagging behind on emission reduction plans and financial pledges to poor countries instead of setting a high bar for global climate action. "The burden falls largely on the G20 to behave like adults, like great nations ought to," Kerry told Reuters on the sidelines of the UN climate talks in Madrid, referring to a grouping of top industrial economies. "We are at a critical stage in terms of being behind (our targets) and the absence of US leadership is one component," he said. Environment ministers from over 190 countries have arrived in Madrid for the high-level part of the COP25 UN climate talks, where government officials will take over from technical experts the negotiation of outstanding issues around the Paris Agreement to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. While the Trump administration has started the process to withdraw the United States - the world's biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gas emissions - from the Paris agreement next year, dozens of US mayors and CEOs have maintained a presence in Madrid as part of the "We Are Still In" coalition - a group of states and cities that are still committed to Paris goals. Former New York Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, who funds the initiative, arrived in Madrid on Tuesday trying to convince other countries that the United States is still a leader on climate change action despite Trump's withdrawal. "We want the rest of the world to know that Americans are continuing to lead on climate change - even with a climate denier in the White House," he said. Negotiators worked late in the night on Monday to hash out rules guiding the use of carbon trading markets to achieve Paris emission reduction targets. They are also grappling with how to address "loss and damage," a mechanism to compensate vulnerable countries that have been struck by climate impacts."
World needs to work together to tackle 'existential challenge' of climate change: Masagos=10 Dec 2019 07:58PM (Updated: 10 Dec 2019 08:24PM)=CNA/hm=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/world-needs-to-work-together-to-tackle-existential-challenge-of-12172820=" MADRID: At a time when multilateralism is under strain, the world needs to strengthen global and regional cooperation to address the “existential challenge” of climate change, said Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli on Tuesday (Dec 10). “Like all small island states, Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of global warming. We strongly echo the call by many for more action and collaboration,” he said at the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid. Mr Masagos also reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming as he delivered Singapore’s national statement at the summit. The conference, which opened last Monday, hopes to resolve issues in implementing the Paris accord, where countries had set goals to cut carbon emissions. Singapore will play its part and update its post-2020 climate actions as agreed under the accord, the minister said. The country had pledged to reduce its emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise its emissions with the aim of peaking around that year. “We will also work with others to support the efforts of developing countries,” he added. He urged countries to finalise the mechanisms under Paris Agreement which will allow them to cooperate in reducing carbon emissions. “It is imperative that we adopt a credible, clear and coherent set of rules to govern the effective use of international carbon credits,” he said. SINGAPORE’S CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION Outlining Singapore’s actions so far, he said that the nation has implemented a carbon tax, and the revenue from that will be used to help companies become more resource and energy efficient, as well as support projects to reduce emissions. It has also adopted a Zero Waste Masterplan and a Resource Sustainability Act to build a “circular economy” – an economic system aimed at eliminating waste. More on Singapore’s efforts and plans were detailed in a full national statement from Mr Masagos which was submitted to the UN. The use of solar energy will be ramped up, the statement said. Solar installations have increased a hundred-fold from 30 to more than 3,000 in Singapore over the last decade. Singapore will continue to find ways to get around its land constraints, such as using floating solar panels, the minister said, adding that the country aims to increase its 2020 solar target by more than five times to at least 2GWp by 2030. Authorities had earlier announced that this represents 4 per cent of Singapore’s current electricity demand. Singapore is also exploring other energy options such as using regional power grids, and has commissioned studies to evaluate the feasibility of alternatives such as hydrogen and carbon capture technology which can use the gasses to produce electricity. A LOW-CARBON FUTURE In his full statement, Mr Masagos said that the Government also has plans to make transport in the city greener by 2040. Twenty years down the road, nine out of every 10 peak-period journeys will be made by walking, cycling or on public transport, the statement said. Singapore also aims to have 100 per cent cleaner energy public bus fleets by 2040. Singapore pledged to actively support international efforts to address the emissions of the aviation and maritime transport sectors. As a financial hub, Singapore has also issued more than US$4.4 billion (S$6 billion) of greed bonds to date. The Singapore Government will help ease the transition to a “climate-resilient” economy and help workers adapt to a low-carbon future, but Mr Masagos emphasised the need for strong multilateral action in the fight against climate change. One example of Singapore’s efforts is its support of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility to improve pre-disaster planning, disaster relief and reconstruction funding in the region. “To succeed in our efforts to address climate change, we need to work hand-in-hand with youths, businesses and civil organisations to co-create and co-deliver solutions to solve our environmental challenges,” he said. The minister accepted an invitation from Chilean COP 25 president Carolina Schmidt to be a co-facilitator with Spanish minister Teresa Ribera Rodriguez on the overarching decision texts for the conference. The role involves canvassing views and inputs on the key decisions of issues that the parties would like to see adopted at COP 25, as well as presenting draft decisions."
Dancing crowds protest in Madrid while climate leaders meet=08 Dec 2019 05:27AM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/dancing-crowds-protest-in-madrid-while-climate-leaders-meet-12164504=" MADRID: Hundreds of people blocked one of Madrid's most emblematic streets on Saturday by dancing to demand action against climate change in what protesters dubbed civil disco-bedience. The protest, called by grassroots green movement Extinction Rebellion, blocked the central shopping street Gran Via. Activists waved flags and danced to songs including the Bee Gees 1977 classic Stayin' Alive. "We've tried all the normal safe ways - petitions, marches, writing letters to the politicians, so now all we can do is civil disobedience," Joan, an Australian who has been living in Madrid for 18 months, told Reuters. "We're here on Gran Via in Madrid doing civil disco-bedience," she added as protesters danced around her. Despite the cool winter temperatures, some of the demonstrators danced topless along the street. The protest coincides with Madrid hosting the annual U.N. climate summit, which opened last Monday with a call from U.N. chief Antonio Guterres not to be the "generation ... that fiddled while the planet burned". By the meeting's close on Dec. 13, negotiators hope to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement an accord struck in Paris in 2015 to avert catastrophic global warming."
Marine life under threat from plummeting oxygen levels=07 Dec 2019 05:13PM (Updated: 07 Dec 2019 05:20PM)=AFP/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/marine-life-under-threat-plummeting-oxygen-levels-12163508=" MADRID: The loss of oxygen from the ocean due to climate change risks "dire effects" on sea life, fisheries and coastal communities, a global conservation body said Saturday (Dec 7). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said that around 700 sites had been identified globally with low oxygen levels - up from only 45 in the 1960s. In the same period, the group warned, the volume of anoxic waters - areas totally devoid of oxygen - have quadrupled. The ocean absorbs around a quarter of all fossil fuel emissions, but as global energy demand continues to grow there are fears that the world's seas will eventually reach saturation point. Oceans are expected on current trends to lose 3.0 to 4.0 per cent of their oxygen globally by 2100. However, most of that loss is predicted to be in the upper 1,000m, that is the richest part of the ocean for biodiversity. "With this report, the scale of damage climate change is wreaking upon the ocean comes into stark focus," said IUCN acting director Grethel Aguilar. "As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray." The largest peer-reviewed study to date on ocean oxygen loss concluded that deoxygenation is already altering the balance of marine life to the detriment of species that need more of the life-giving gas. Species such as tuna, marlin and sharks - many of which are already endangered - are particularly sensitive to low oxygen levels due to their large size and energy demands. But loss of oxygen is affecting species across the food chain. The biomes that support around a fifth of the world's current fish catch are formed by ocean currents that bring oxygen-poor water in to coastlines. These areas are especially vulnerable to even tiny variations in oxygen levels. "Impacts here will ultimately ripple out and affect hundreds of millions of people," the IUCN said. The group this year issued a landmark assessment of the world's natural habitats, concluding starkly that human activity was threatening up to one million species with extinction. Ocean life is already battling warmer temperatures, rampant overfishing and plastic pollution. The World Meterological Organisation this week said that due to man-made emissions growth, the ocean is now 26 per cent more acidic than before the Industrial Revolution. CLIMATE CHANGE, POLLUTION "Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification," said Dan Laffoley, a senior marine science adviser at the IUCN. "To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas, we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources." The IUCN report also found that pollution around coastlines was having a significant effect on oxygen levels, with fertiliser and agricultural run off promoting more algae growth, which in turn depletes oxygen as it decomposes. World leaders will gather in Marseille in June for the IUCN's World Conservation Congress. Policymakers are currently in negotiations at the COP25 climate summit in Madrid charged with ratifying a comprehensive rulebook for the 2015 Paris accord. "Decisions taken at the ongoing climate conference will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly and irrevocably lost," said IUCN global marine and polar programme director Minna Epps."
Activist Thunberg completes intercontinental dash to Madrid climate summit=06 Dec 2019 05:08PM=Reuters/nh=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/activist-thunberg-completes-intercontinental-dash-to-madrid-climate-summit-12160072=" MADRID: Teenage activist Greta Thunberg pulled in on the overnight train to Madrid on Friday (Dec 6), heading to a gathering of world leaders she says are failing to combat climate change. In just over a year, Thunberg has inspired younger protesters in a global movement demanding action to slow the atmospheric warming that climate scientists say could ultimately endanger the survival of industrial societies. Stepping off the night train Lusitania at Chamartin train station in the Spanish capital, the 16-year-old Swede completed a hastily arranged expedition, including a 21-day catamaran voyage across the Atlantic, to a UN conference originally planned in Santiago, Chile. Thunberg was met by a crowd of reporters but did not speak as she left the train. "I successfully managed to sneak into Madrid this morning! I don't think anyone saw me ... Anyway it's great to be in Spain!" Thunberg tweeted after leaving the station. The Lusitania, which runs daily, is the only direct train link between Lisbon and Madrid and takes nine hours to travel overnight between the capitals. The annual summit kicked off on Monday with a call from UN chief Antonio Guterres not to be the "generation ... that fiddled while the planet burned". Thunberg is due to take part in a mass march and make a speech later in Madrid. At the last UN climate event in September, she harangued delegates, demanding: "How dare you?" and declaring, "You have stolen my dreams." By this meeting's close on Dec 13, negotiators hope to resolve remaining disagreements on how to implement an agreement struck in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. They saved the deal from disintegrating last year by agreeing guidelines for putting it into effect, but current pledges fall well short of the temperature target and sticking points remain among signatories. President Donald Trump has started the process of withdrawing the United States, the top historic greenhouse gas emitter, from the accord. Spain has said a desire to prevent this move from sapping morale around the project was one of its reasons for offering to host after riots over inequality prompted Chile to withdraw. The Chilean delegation remains responsible for presiding over the negotiations."
'Mega fire' forms north of Sydney=06 Dec 2019 03:27PM (Updated: 07 Dec 2019 01:54AM)=AFP/nh/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/mega-fire-forms-north-of-sydney-12159340=" SYDNEY: Several Australian bushfires have combined to form a "mega fire" that is burning out of control across a swathe of land north of Sydney, authorities said on Friday (Dec 7), warning they cannot contain the blaze. New South Wales Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers said "there are probably more than eight fires in all" that have merged to form what has been dubbed a "mega fire" in an area of national park forest. The blaze was burning across 300,000 hectares - an area roughly 60 kilometres across - within an hour's drive of Australia's largest city, which was again subsumed in a soup of toxic smoke. "There is just fire that whole way" said Rogers, who added that firefighters could do little more than get any residents out, protect property and hope for an end to fire-friendly dry and windy conditions. We "cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them," he told public broadcaster ABC. "The best thing we can do is try to protect property and people as much as we can." Prolonged drought has left much of eastern Australia tinder-dry and spot fires have raged every day for the past three months. Bushfires are common in Australia but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought and climatic conditions fuelled by global warming. Dramatic footage of firefighters running from a wall of fire ripping through the tree canopy above them was captured overnight in Orangeville, less than 100 kilometres west of Sydney. The local fire and rescue team that shot the images said no one was injured and the vehicles surrounded by the swirling embers also survived the blaze. "The video was put up to demonstrate why you need to listen to the fire advisory system," the team from Ingleburn fire station said on Facebook. "If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and your (sic) not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away," they warned. At a wildlife park in the area, 300 animals were evacuated. Walkabout Wildlife Park said it had shipped out lizards, dingoes, peacocks and marsupials, as firefighters battled more than 100 fires up and down the eastern seaboard. "This fire has been doing some crazy things, so we have to be prepared," general manager Tassin Barnard told AFP. New South Wales rural fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons said some US and Canadian firefighters had arrived to help out. The specialists are expected to supervise waterbombing planes and heavy equipment used in creating fire containment lines. "We are not only appreciative of their presence here today, but of their sacrifice," said Fitzsimmons - who has become a fixture on Australian television screens for weeks, updating the public on blazes in towns, national parks and backwaters. "They are volunteering to sacrifice time from loved ones, from families, to give up that special time of the year around Christmas and New Year to come down here and lend us a hand," he said. More than 600 homes have been destroyed and six people have died since the crisis began in September. That is many fewer than Australia's deadliest recent fire season in 2009 when almost 200 people died, but 2019's toll so far belies the scale of devastation. An estimated two million hectares have burned - the size of some small countries - across a region spanning hundreds of kilometres. The fires have taken a toll in Sydney and other major cities, which have been blanketed in toxic smoke for weeks and occasionally sprinkled with snow-like embers. Fitzsimmons said he could not "overstate the effect that this profound drought is having" as he warned of a long, painful summer ahead. "There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation ... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely.""
GM, LG Chem to build US$2.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Ohio=05 Dec 2019 05:55PM (Updated: 06 Dec 2019 09:20AM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/gm--lg-chem-to-build-us-2-3-billion-electric-vehicle-battery-plant-in-ohio-12156086=" WARREN, Mich.: General Motors Co and South Korea's LG Chem said on Thursday they will invest US$2.3 billion to build an electric vehicle battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities. The plant, to be built near GM's closed assembly plant in Lordstown in northeast Ohio, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said. Construction is to begin in mid-2020 and the plant will have an annual capacity of more than 30 gigawatt hours with the flexibility to expand. At a media briefing, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the 50-50 joint venture with LG Chem is aimed at "dramatically enhancing electric vehicle affordability and profitability." Barra said the Ohio battery plant will accelerate the automaker's initiative to introduce 20 new electric vehicles globally by 2023. "General Motors believes in the science of global warming and believes in an all-electric future," she said. Barra said the battery cells will be used in a GM electric pickup which will start production in fall 2021 at the company's Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which eventually will "have more than one product." In October, Reuters reported the Detroit-Hamtramck plant is expected to build at least four different electric vehicles, including an SUV for Cadillac and a pickup for GMC. The Ohio battery cell plant will boost LG Chem's global battery capacity to 100 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2020, LG Chem CEO Hak-Cheol Shin said at the briefing. Each company will invest about US$916 million, with the rest coming from debt capital raised by joint venture, a GM spokeswoman said. Electric vehicle industry suppliers were cheered by the news, especially GM's talk of an EV truck as pickups and SUVs are the heart of the U.S. market. LG Chem's cross-town rival SK Innovation , which counts Volkswagen and Daimler among its customers, broke ground in March on a US$1.7 billion EV battery factory in Commerce, Georgia, about 200 km from Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant, which will be the automaker's EV hub in the United States. SK Innovation's U.S. factory is scheduled to begin mass production in 2022. "We’ve been trying to make it clear to everyone that the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain will grow when more (automakers) make more EV trucks here in the country," said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium Ltd , which is developing a lithium mine near Charlotte, North Carolina. Lithium is a key material in EV batteries. Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the GM-LG Chem plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn US$15 to US$17 an hour. If so, it would be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla's Nevada battery factory and LG Chem's battery plant in Michigan do not have unions. Barra said the plant's workers would decide whether a union represents them, and said pay would be competitive with other parts plants. The average pay for a UAW worker at GM is about US$31 an hour. Barra said Ohio is providing financial incentives for the plant, but declined to provide details. Ohio became a political lightning rod last year after GM announced plans to close the Lordstown car manufacturing plant. The closure was one issue during a lengthy strike by GM workers, and U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the move. White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro told Reuters he thinks the plant will expand over time and be a significant anchor of employment in Lordstown. "The battery plant itself is a critical part of GM’s overall strategy to dominate the EV market over the next several decades," Navarro said.

The Ohio battery cell plant will boost LG Chem's global battery capacity to 100 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2020, LG Chem CEO Hak-Cheol Shin said at the briefing. Each company will invest about US$916 million, with the rest coming from debt capital raised by joint venture, a GM spokeswoman said. Electric vehicle industry suppliers were cheered by the news, especially GM's talk of an EV truck as pickups and SUVs are the heart of the U.S. market. "We’ve been trying to make it clear to everyone that the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain will grow when more (automakers) make more EV trucks here in the country,” said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium Ltd, which is developing a lithium mine near Charlotte, North Carolina. Lithium is a key material in EV batteries. Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the GM-LG Chem plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn US$15 to US$17 an hour. If so, it would be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla's Nevada battery factory and LG Chem's battery plant in Michigan do not have unions. Barra said the plant's workers would decide whether a union represents them, and said pay would be competitive with other parts plants. The average pay for a UAW worker at GM is about US$31 an hour. Barra said Ohio is providing financial incentives for the plant, but declined to provide details. Ohio became a political lightning rod last year after GM announced plans to close the Lordstown car manufacturing plant. The closure was one issue during a lengthy strike by GM workers, and U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the move. White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro told Reuters he thinks the plant will expand over time and be a significant anchor of employment in Lordstown. "The battery plant itself is a critical part of GM’s overall strategy to dominate the EV market over the next several decades," Navarro said.

Spray-painted polar bear sparks alarm in Russia=04 Dec 2019 08:27PM (Updated: 04 Dec 2019 08:30PM)=AFP/aa=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/spray-painted-polar-bear-sparks-alarm-in-russia-12152742=" MOSCOW: A video showing a polar bear daubed with painted slogan T-34, the name of a Soviet era tank, has caused alarm in Russia with experts saying it could prevent the bear hunting. Local media reported Tuesday (Dec 3) that scientists had marked the bear because it was scavenging for food near a human-inhabited area in the Arctic region. The video was posted on Facebook on Monday by Sergei Kavry, who works for the World Wildlife Fund in the Chukotka region. He said he was concerned at the large letters daubed on the side of the bear, seen plodding through snow. "Why? Why? He won't be able to hunt inconspicuously," Kavry wrote. Kavry said he found the video on a WhatsApp social media group and did not know where it was shot. A senior researcher at the Institute of Biological Problems of the North in far eastern Russia, Anatoly Kochnev, told RIA Novosti news agency he did not know where the video was shot, but the letters could have been painted on by "jokers". "At first, until he cleans himself off, it will be hard for him to hunt," the scientist said. Severpress news agency, based in the Yamalo-Nenetsky region, some 2,000km northeast of Moscow, reported that the marks were put on by an expedition of scientists on Novaya Zemlya, a remote and sparsely populated Arctic archipelago. It cited experts as saying a team of scientists from Moscow went to investigate a polar bear that was raiding a settlement's rubbish tip and they marked the bear to see if it returned. The agency quoted Ilya Mordvintsev, a senior researcher from Moscow's Institute of Problems of Ecology and Evolution, as saying the expedition members caught the bear and sedated it. Finding the animal was well-fed and therefore would not attack humans, they took it to a safe distance from the settlement and marked it with paint that would wash off in two weeks, to see if it returned to scavenge, he said. The video was apparently shot last week, the agency reported. Polar bears regularly visit areas inhabited by humans in Arctic Russia to search for food, often in rubbish tips. In February in Novaya Zemlya, officials sounded the alarm over an "invasion" of 52 bears in the main settlement there. The bears are affected by global warming with melting Arctic ice forcing them to spend more time on land where they compete for food."
Climate activist Greta Thunberg reaches Lisbon on way to Madrid summit=03 Dec 2019 10:08PM (Updated: 03 Dec 2019 10:08PM)=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-activist-greta-thunberg-reaches-lisbon-on-way-to-madrid-summit-12148974=" LISBON: Climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived in Lisbon on Tuesday (Dec 3) after crossing the Atlantic from New York aboard a catamaran ahead of her appearance at a summit in Madrid to demand urgent action on global warming. The boat, La Vagabonde, carried the Swedish campaigner, who refuses to travel by plane, across the ocean so she could attend the COP25 climate summit in Madrid. She will spend the day holding meetings with Portuguese climate activists and resting before her departure for Madrid. More than 150 supporters turned out to greet Thunberg as she came ashore. Among them was the leader of Portugal's People Animals Nature party, Andre Silva, who praised Thunberg for her role in "tackling the greatest crisis of our times". "She is prioritising an increasingly urgent issue in a way politicians just aren’t," he told Reuters. Her arrival in Lisbon coincides with the release of a bleak report by the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organisation, which warns that the past decade is almost certain to be the hottest yet recorded. Portugal’s environment minister Matos Fernandes thanked Greta for her activism in a letter last Thursday, having already departed for COP25. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said it was a "great pleasure" to have her in Lisbon but did not feel it was his place to personally greet the activist. Thunberg missed last Friday’s climate strike as heavy winds delayed her arrival in Lisbon but she is due to join thousands of activists marching in Madrid on Friday afternoon on the fringes of the COP25. The conference kicked off on Monday with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that the planet had reached a "point of no return". Top priorities include establishing a common time frame for countries to implement their national climate commitment plans, and resolving the issue of international carbon markets. That issue is the only one from the Paris rule book endorsed in 2015 which delegates failed to agree at last year’s COP24 in Poland."
2010s hottest decade in history, UN says as emissions rise again=03 Dec 2019 04:54PM (Updated: 03 Dec 2019 08:31PM)=AFP/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2010s-hottest-decade-in-history-un-emissions-climate-change-12148054=" MADRID: This decade is set to be the hottest in history, the United Nations said on Tuesday (Dec 3) in an annual assessment outlining the ways in which climate change is outpacing humanity's ability to adapt to it. The World Meterological Organization said global temperatures so far this year were 1.1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average, putting 2019 on course to be in the top three warmest years ever recorded. Man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels, building infrastructure, growing crops and transporting goods mean 2019 is set to break the record for atmospheric carbon concentrations, locking in further warming, the WMO said. Oceans, which absorb 90 per cent of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gases, are now at their highest recorded temperatures. The world's seas are now a quarter more acidic than 150 years ago, threatening vital marine ecosystems upon which billions of people rely for food and jobs. In October, the global mean sea level reached its highest on record, fuelled by the 329 billion tonnes of ice lost from the Greenland ice sheet in 12 months. UP TO 22 MILLION DISPLACED Each of the last four decades has been hotter than the last. And far from climate change being a phenomenon for future generations to confront, the effects of humanity's insatiable, growth-at-any cost consumption means millions are already counting the damage. The report said more than 10 million people were internally displaced in the first half of 2019 - seven million directly due to extreme weather events such as storms, flooding and drought.   By the end of the year, the WMO said new displacements due to weather extremes could reach 22 million. "Once again in 2019 weather and climate related risks hit hard," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. "Heatwaves and floods which used to be 'once in a century' events are becoming more regular occurrences." At just 1 degree Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, 2019 has already seen deadly heatwaves in Europe, Australia and Japan, superstorms devastate southeast Africa, and wildfires rage out of control in Australia and California. 'NOT ADAPTING' Nations are currently in crucial talks in Madrid aimed at finalising rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which enjoins countries to work to limit global temperature rises to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year outlined how vital it was for mankind to aim for a safer cap of 1.5 degree Celsius - ideally by slashing greenhouse gas emissions and retooling the global economy towards renewable energy. The UN said last week in its annual "emissions gap" assessment that the world needed to cut carbon emissions by 7.6 per cent each year, every year, until 2030 to hit 1.5 degree Celsius. Instead, emissions are rising.   And while governments spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidising fossil fuels, there appears to be no consensus in Madrid over how countries already dealing with climate-related catastrophe can fund efforts to adapt to the new reality. "Our economic activities continue to use the atmosphere as a waste dump for greenhouse gases," said Joeri Rogelj, Grantham Lecturer in Climate Change at Imperial College London. "The increasing temperatures, the warming oceans, ocean acidification and other indicators are the logical consequence of this inaction and this should worry us deeply." Even if all Paris pledges were honoured, Earth is still on course to be more than 3 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of the century. "There is no indication of a fade out of the warming," Taalas told reporters. "The numbers will be higher if we continue our current behaviour." Part of the discussions in Madrid is aimed at getting countries to increase their climate action ambition ahead of a deadline next year. Friederike Otto, deputy director of the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute, said the WMO report "highlights that we are not even adapted to 1.1 degree of warming." "And there is no doubt that this 1.1 degree is due to the burning of fossil fuels," he said. Christian Aid's global climate lead Kat Kramer said the WMO report showed the need for concrete progress in Madrid. "Delegates have no excuse to block progress or drag their feet when the science is showing how urgently action is needed," she said."
New facility to produce up to 5 million Wolbachia mosquitoes weekly in fight against dengue=02 Dec 2019 08:08PM (Updated: 02 Dec 2019 11:47PM)=CNA/cc(rw)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wolbachia-mosquitoes-new-facility-aedes-aegypti-dengue-12145012=" SINGAPORE: A new S$5 million mosquito production facility opened on Monday (Dec 2), as part of the National Environment Agency's (NEA) latest efforts to combat dengue. This comes in the wake of a surge of dengue cases in Singapore this year, with close to 15,000 cases and 20 deaths reported, said Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor, who spoke at the opening. Dr Khor said that global warming and climate change would likely worsen Singapore's dengue situation. "This is because mosquitoes breed faster at higher temperatures, and the dengue virus also replicates faster, allowing it to be transmitted more efficiently," she said. With 10 times the production capability of NEA's previous Neythal Road facility, the new Ang Mo Kio facility hopes to eventually produce five million mosquitoes a week, crucial to helping NEA meet its goal of expanding Project Wolbachia field trials.   Project Wolbachia involves infecting male aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria, so that when it mates with a female, the eggs will not hatch. Male Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes also do not bite. Project Wolbachia entered its fourth phase in November 2019, expanding trials to 284 residential blocks at Tampines West and Nee Soon East. Previously, phase 3 covered 144 residential blocks in the same areas and achieved a 90 per cent suppression rate. HIGHLY AUTOMATED FACILITY The new facility at Techplace II involves the use of automation to drastically reduce the time needed to produce male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes. The devices will free up the time spent on "tedious and repetitive work", said NEA CEO Tan Meng Dui on Monday.   A larvae counter will reduce the time needed to count larvae manually by up to 40 times, while a pupae sorter will reduce the time needed to separate male and female pupae manually by up to 20 times. Other technologies such as an automated feeding system, a compact rearing rack to grow pupae and a mosquito launcher helps NEA officers to increase the number of mosquitoes harvested and released in a shorter period of time. There is also a water recycling system that allows NEA to recover up to 70 per cent of waste water from the facility. "This facility serves multiple functions," said Mr Tan. "Besides providing us with the scalability we need to expand male Wolbachia-aedes mosquito releases, it also serves as an incubator and test bed for innovative solutions, and provides a space for learning and mutual exchange of ideas."   A system to inject low-dose radiation into Wolbachia-aedes aegypti female mosquitoes was also developed in conjunction with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The radiation will make any Wolbachia-carrying females that are accidentally sorted with male pupae infertile, as the Project Wolbachia technology depends on breeding Wolbachia-carrying males with non-Wolbachia-carrying females.   While effective, Dr Khor noted that Wolbachia technology is not "a silver bullet for dengue control". "Wolbachia is meant to enhance, not replace, our existing vector control strategies, which are focused on source reduction," she said."
United Nations opens two-week climate change summit in Madrid=02 Dec 2019 04:36PM=Reuters/nr=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/united-nation-climate-change-summit-madrid-12144504=" MADRID: The United Nations opened a two-week climate summit in Madrid on Monday (Dec 1), where world leaders face growing pressure to prove they can muster the political will to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. The talks began against a backdrop of increasingly visible impacts from rising temperatures in the past year, with wildfires raging from the Arctic and the Amazon to Australia, and tropical regions hit by devastating hurricanes. Michal Kurtyka, Poland's climate minister who led the last round of UN climate negotiations in the Polish city of Katowice in December last year, said a surge in climate activism among young people underscored the urgency of the task. "Maybe the world is not moving yet at the pace we would like but my hope is still particularly with the young people," Kurtyka told the official opening ceremony of the talks at a vast conference centre in Madrid. "They have the courage to speak up and remind us that we inherited this planet from our parents, and we need to hand it over to the future generations," Kurtyka said. The conference aims to lay the final pieces of groundwork needed to support the 2015 Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, which enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Existing pledges made under the accord fall far short of the kind of action needed to avert the most disastrous consequences of global warming in terms of sea-level rise, drought, storms and other impacts, scientists say."
Europe to consider law on climate neutrality by March=29 Nov 2019 09:59PM=Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/europe-to-consider-law-on-climate-neutrality-by-march-12138742=" BRUSSELS: The European Union (EU) executive will propose by March 2020 a new climate law to turn the bloc neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and help lead the planet's struggle against global warming, a draft showed on Friday (Nov 29). The European Commission document, to be published on Dec 11 and seen by Reuters, also said it would by next October present a plan to halve the bloc's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Anxiety is growing around the world that governments are not doing enough to reach the Paris Agreement's target of curbing emissions sufficiently to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. The 28-nation EU, where floods and heatwaves of recent years have been increasingly linked to climate change, says it wants to be at the forefront of action. But there are divisions. Some EU countries dependent on coal for energy like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, oppose the 2050 carbon neutral target, arguing they need help transforming energy production. To win them over, the Commission, whose proposed laws require consent of members and the EU parliament, wants to create a "just transition fund" to wean economies off coal. It did not specify any financial details. The draft document also said the EU executive would propose extending the bloc's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to the maritime sector and possibly road transport, plus reducing free carbon dioxide allowances for airlines. The Commission said it would push for a shift from road and aviation transport to rail, try to ensure that 75 per cent of road transport is moved to other means, and deploy alternative infrastructure and fuels. Moreover, the EU also wants to create sustainability criteria for batteries, launch a forest restoration plan and strengthen requirements for monitoring air pollution in cities. The Commission, whose incoming head Ursula von der Leyen is prioritising the environment, wants to earmark a yet unspecified amount of money in the EU's next long-term budget from 2021 to support clean public transport and take action in ports to clean up ships' emissions. The draft said the EU executive would present an action plan on financing the shift to a greener economy in June 2020 and make sure every future trade agreement includes an ambitious dedicated chapter on sustainable development."
Mumbai slum-dwellers by the sea live at the mercy of climate change=29 Nov 2019 08:29PM=Reuters/ga=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/mumbai-slum-dwellers-by-the-sea-live-at-the-mercy-of-climate-change-12138698=" MUMBAI: Already at risk from rains, flooding and open sewers, slum-dwellers who live by the ocean in the Indian financial capital Mumbai are vulnerable to rising seas caused by global warming and say the government should help them move to safer locations. Thousands of people, mostly migrants from other parts of the country, live in temporary shelters, built on rocks at the edge of the sea and are likely to be the first hit from coastal flooding caused by climate change. "Even hearing about (the rising sea levels) we feel afraid. What do we do? We have been living here for so many years. It would be good if the government could do something to help us," said Kamakshi Tangesh Devender, who lives in a slum in Worli neighbourhood. Climate change poses a greater threat to poor communities in developing nations like India, Indonesia and the Philippines, with people living on the margins less able to protect themselves from the impact.   A research paper last month by Climate Central, a US-based non-profit climate science and news organisation, found that climate change will put an estimated 300 million people globally at risk of coastal flooding by 2050. The UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report in September that sea levels could rise by 1m by 2100 — 10 times the rate in the 20th century — if carbon emissions that are responsible for climate change keep climbing. "Mumbai is going to be under water, we need to plan for that eventuality and what is required is to plan a new city to replace Mumbai as and when it gets submerged. And ideally, to my mind, it should be somewhere inland – at a pretty substantial elevation," Debi Goenka, an environmental activist, told Reuters. As well as changing sea levels, scientists say climate change is causing an increase in extreme weather events around the world such as drought and floods. Mumbai has been hit this year by incessant rains and flooding, causing loss of life and property and halting essential services like local transport. The city received 66per cent more rainfall than average during the June to September monsoon season, breaking a record set in 1954. Governments are meeting at a UN summit on climate change in Madrid on Dec 2-13."
Europeans fear climate change more than terrorism, unemployment or migration=28 Nov 2019 11:25PM=Reuters/ad=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/europeans-fear-climate-change-more-than-terrorism--unemployment-or-migration-12135860=" BRUSSELS: Almost half of all Europeans fear climate change more than losing a job or of a terrorist attack, a study by the European Investment Bank (EIB) showed on Thursday (Nov 28) as EU lawmakers declared a "climate emergency". The symbolic vote by lawmakers was designed to pressure for action against global warming at an upcoming United Nations summit. The EIB survey of 30,000 respondents from 30 countries, including China and the United States, showed 47 per cent of Europeans saw climate change as the number one threat in their lives, above unemployment, large scale migration and concerns about terrorism. "European citizens are highly concerned about climate change and its impact on their everyday life and future," said Emma Navarro, EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action and the environment. "Interestingly, many of them are optimistic about the possibility to reverse it. Unfortunately, science says otherwise. We have one shot at limiting global warming and mitigating its effects," she said. The EIB, owned by European Union governments, is the world's largest international public lending institution and has the task of financing climate-change related investment that is a priority for the new European Commission. The survey, the first of four planned by the EIB, showed the level of concern about climate change was even higher in China than the EU, with 73 per cent of respondents seeing it as the biggest threat to society, compared to 39 per cent in the United States, where most people worried more about access to health services. The study also showed that 41 per cent of young Europeans between the age of 15 and 29, especially from southern countries like Spain, Greece and France thought they would have to move to another country because of the changing climate. "Overall, 82 per cent of Europeans report that climate change has an impact on their everyday lives, a perception that goes up to 98 per cent in China and 76 per cent in the United States," the study said. The incoming European Commission, which will start on Dec 1, wants to make the whole of the European Union an area that is neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 after slashing emissions by 50 per cent by 2030. It still requires the consent of all EU governments before such a target becomes binding, but some countries which still heavily depend on coal like Poland, oppose such ambition."
Shrinking lake in Mali spells end of line for family of fishermen=27 Nov 2019 04:37PM=Reuters/zl=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/shrinking-lake-in-mali-spells-end-of-line-for-family-of-fishermen-12130292=" LAC WEGNIA, Mali: Modeste Traore has lived his whole life by Lake Wegnia, in Mali's Sahel region, and its fish have provided him with a livelihood that supports his extended family of 14 children. But as temperatures rise, evaporation increases and the lake shrinks - phenomena experts blame on global climate change - so do the chances of his children following in the fisherman's footsteps. "If things go on like this I don't think our children can become fishermen like us," the 56-year-old told Reuters, holding one of his young sons on his knee.   "During the rainy season there is a lot of water but as soon as it's over, there is no water left in the lake. We are fishermen. I don't think our children will be." Lake Wegnia, or Lac Wegnia in French, is located in the Sahel region of Koulikoro, around 120km north of the capital Bamako. Some 12,000 people including fishermen, farmers and herders depend on it for food, water and income, while its fresh waters and marshes also contain rich biodiversity. But the lake has shrunk by 20 per cent since 2017, according to figures from CIDR (International Centre for Development and Research) and analysis from Hydrosolutions, placing huge pressure on local communities. The United Nations describes the Sahel region - a wide strip of land running across northern Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea - as "one of the most environmentally degraded regions in the world".   The organisation has projected temperatures there to increase 1.5 times higher than the global average, and says the Sahel is regularly hit by droughts and floods. Food insecurity, the fight for arable land and fast population growth can lead to conflict, although Lake Wegnia so far has been spared the violence prevalent in other parts of Mali.   Aid group Caritas Suisse and the Eco-Lac Wegnia project it is leading are working to change agricultural practices, improve water management and fight the effects of global warming. Eco-Lac Wegnia's local coordinator Moussa Savagodo said failing to make changes quickly could mean the lake disappears altogether in less than 5 years.   Villagers in Wegnia and Kononi-Sirakoro have already planted 56,000 trees in the last two years and are better managing their water resources by building stone cordons to help the soil retain what rainfall there is. Despite the progress and international support, though, Traore is now raising cattle, because he can't catch enough fish to feed his family.  "

China says CO2 border tax will damage global climate change efforts=27 Nov 2019 11:25AM=Reuters/nc=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/eu-carbon-border-tax-china-climate-change-12129108=" BEIJING: Proposals by the European Union to establish a "carbon border tax" will damage the global community's willingness to take joint action against climate change, China said on Wednesday (Nov 27). The EU's new climate commissioner Frans Timmermans said in October that research would begin on the new tax, which is aimed at protecting European firms from unfair competition by raising the cost of products from countries that fail to take adequate action against climate change. But Europe's proposals, together with the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement, would seriously harm international efforts to tackle global warming, said Zhao Yingmin, China's vice environment minister, at a briefing on Wednesday. "We need to send a strong political signal to uphold multilateralism," he said. "We need to prevent unilateralism and protectionism from hurting global growth expectations and the will of countries to combat climate change together." Any border tax would likely raise the price of Chinese goods in the European market, and Beijing believes it would violate a core principle of the Paris agreement on climate change, which says richer countries should bear the greater responsibility for cutting emissions. As part of its national commitments to the fight against global warming, China - the world's largest emitter of climate warming greenhouse gas - has pledged to bring its emissions to a peak by "around 2030". It has also cut levels of carbon intensity - the amount produced per unit of economic growth - by 48.5 per cent from 2005 to 2018, two years ahead of schedule, Zhao said. But the United States says the Paris accord is unfair to US firms because it does not do enough to tackle emissions from competitors in China and India. China's total annual emissions stood at around 14 gigatonnes in 2018, according to a study published by the United Nations this week, more than twice the US level. China's per capita emissions are around the same as Japan and the European Union. China was also making progress on its long-awaited efforts to build a nationwide carbon trading platform, Li Gao, head of the climate change office at the environment ministry, told the briefing, though he did not give a timeframe. China pledged to launch the platform in 2017 as part of its Paris commitments, but it has faced a series of technical difficulties."
Slash emissions now or miss 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, UN warns==AFP/ad=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/climate-change-un-emissions-fossil-fuels-12126850=" PARIS: The world will miss its chance to avert climate disaster without an immediate and all-but-impossible fall in fossil fuel emissions, the UN said on Tuesday (Nov 26) in its annual assessment on greenhouse gases. The United Nations Environment Programme said that global emissions need to fall by 7.6 per cent each year, every year until 2030 to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The harsh reality is that emissions have risen on average 1.5 per cent annually over the last decade, hitting a record 55.3 billion tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases in 2018 - three years after 195 countries signed the Paris treaty on climate change. The World Meteorological Organization said Monday that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations hit an all-time record in 2018. The Paris deal committed nations to limit temperature rises above pre-industrial levels to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius, and to a safer 1.5 degrees Celsius if at all possible. To do so they agreed on the need to reduce emissions and work towards a low-carbon world within decades. Yet the UN found that even taking into account current Paris pledges, the world is on track for a 3.2 degrees Celsius temperature rise, something scientists fear could tear at the fabric of society.   Even if every country made good on its promises, Earth's "carbon budget" for a 1.5-degree Celsius rise - the amount we can emit to stay below a certain temperature threshold - would be exhausted within a decade. In its own words, the UN assessment is "bleak". While it insisted the 1.5-degrees Celsius goal is still attainable, it acknowledged that this would require an unprecedented, coordinated upheaval of a global economy that is still fuelled overwhelmingly by oil- and gas-fuelled growth. "We are failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions," UNEP's executive director, Inger Andersen, told AFP. "Unless we take urgent action now and make very significant cuts to global emissions we're going to miss the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius" COST OF INACTION The Emissions Gap report, now in its tenth year, also details the cost of a decade of government inaction. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, just after the Copenhagen summit that breathed new life into the debate, annual needed emissions cuts would be 0.7 per cent for 2 degrees Celsius of warming and 3.3 per cent for 1.5 degrees Celsius. "10 years of climate procrastination has led us to where we are today," said Andersen. The report highlighted specific "opportunities" for big emitters to push their economies into line with the Paris goals.   While advice varies between countries, the theme is clear: Completely phase out coal, significantly pare back oil and gas, and dramatically build up renewable energy. G20 nations were singled out as laggards: although they produce around 78 per cent of all emissions, only 15 rich nations have outlined plans to reach net-zero. The Trump administration, meanwhile, notified the UN earlier this month that the US will pull out of the Paris treaty, and has taken steps to boost fossil fuel production, including subsidies for technology to capture and store CO2 emissions from power plants. In all, countries must increase their contributions to the climate fight five-fold to deliver the cuts needed for 1.5 degrees Celsius. 'NO SIGN OF PEAK' Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the world's leading scientific body on the subject - issued a stark warning that going beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius would increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, superstorms and mass flooding. With just 1 degrees Celsius of warming so far, 2019 is projected to be the second hottest in human history, a year marred by deadly wildfires and cyclones rendered more frequent as temperatures climb.   And despite the need for urgent action, with global energy demand set to continue rising for years, the UN itself conceded Tuesday that "there is no sign of (greenhouse) gas emissions peaking in the next few years". That turning point should have come years ago, said Alden Meyer, director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We are not running out of time - we are already out of time," he told AFP. The report said emissions would need to drop 55 per cent by 2030 to stay on a 1.5 degrees Celsius track - an unprecedented fall at a time of sustained global growth. John Ferguson, director of country analysis at The Economist Intelligence Unity, said he was pessimistic that countries could undertake emissions cuts in the time required. "There's the emissions gap but there's also the gap between rhetoric and action, and that gap explains my pessimism that we're not going to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius" he told AFP."

Bloomberg News to make editorial changes for owner's presidential run==AFP/de=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/bloomberg-news-to-make-editorial-changes-for-owner-s-12122340=" WASHINGTON: Bloomberg News on Sunday (Nov 24) outlined several editorial changes it will make as it adjusts to a novel situation – covering its owner as he runs for president. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed he is joining the crowded field of Democrats seeking to take on his fellow New York billionaire, President Donald Trump, just three months before the first primary. "There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy," said John Micklethwait, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg's namesake news agency, in a staff email. He cited the company's policy of not writing about itself or direct competitors. Micklethwait outlined a few editorial changes the agency will make but stressed it would make campaign coverage decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than following an "exhaustive rulebook". "The place where Mike has had the most contact with Editorial is Bloomberg Opinion: our editorials have reflected his views," Micklethwait wrote. As a result, the company will end its policy of unsigned editorials. They will also suspend the editorial board, in part because several board members will take leaves of absence to join Bloomberg's campaign. Micklethwait said he intends for the company to cover the campaign's news "in much the same way as we have done before", with the exception that articles will explicitly state that Bloomberg News' owner is a candidate. In the email, Micklethwait added that they will not investigate Bloomberg's family or foundations - the same would go for his Democratic rivals - but would publish or summarise investigative pieces on all Democratic candidates. "Bloomberg News has handled these conflicts before," Micklethwait wrote, pointing to Bloomberg's mayoral campaign when the media agency adopted similar coverage policies. Bloomberg is poised to run as a centrist, and analysts suspect that he could take away some of the support enjoyed by fellow moderate Joe Biden. Some believe that his "self-made man" image and support for fighting global warming makes him the best challenger for Trump."
Natural gas, false hope in climate change campaign?=22 Nov 2019 07:53PM (Updated: 22 Nov 2019 08:00PM)=AFP/ec=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/natural-gas-false-hope-in-climate-change-campaign-12118056=" PARIS: Natural gas is cleaner and produces fewer global warming emissions than other fossil fuels, making it key to our transition to a low-carbon future, but it comes with its own serious drawbacks. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said recently that natural gas is crucial to its sustainable development model which requires oil and coal use to fall sharply if we are to get anywhere near the Paris agreement climate change targets. Natural gas is relatively cheap, abundant and produces 50 per cent less CO2 than coal, used widely, especially in Asia to generate electricity for fast growing economies. In its latest annual report, the IEA pencilled in a 10 per cent increase in natural gas use through to the end of the 2020s while oil use would have to return to levels last seen in the 1990s. Some NGOs, however, attack the IEA - set up after the first great oil shock in 1973-74 to advise countries how to manage their energy needs - for being overly beholden to nae-say governments such as the United States, and the huge fossil fuel companies. Rather than recommending an increase in the use of natural gas, the IEA should be calling for a reduction, they say. Murray Worthy at Global Witness said "governments should not be misled ... and should rather work on closing down existing oil and gas fields, and halting exploration for new reserves." Significantly, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the lending arm of the European Union, recently announced that it would halt funding new fossil energy projects, including natural gas, from 2022. GOOD AND BAD? For some, natural gas is the ideal transition fuel, with major companies such as Total and Shell producing increasing amounts and launching new projects which stretch for decades into the future. "When it burns, natural gas releases less CO2, nitrous oxide and sulphur than coal or oil," said Nicholas Browne of energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. "Replacing coal with gas, for example, has had a huge impact on air quality in northern China, with immense benefits in terms of public health," Browne said. The question however is "if gas and LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) are better, are they good enough?" he added. Extracting and transporting natural gas notably results in significant emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than CO2. "Methane emissions linked to ... natural gas are largely under-estimated," said Cecile Marchand of Friends of the Earth. Taken together, it is not necessarily the case that natural gas is so much better than other fossil fuels, Marchand said, and on that basis, it may "not allow us to face up to the climate change challenge." The gas industry is trying to meet these criticism, committing to reducing methane emissions and developing CO2 capture systems in the hope of keeping global warming at manageable levels."
Greener, longer life: More trees reduce premature deaths in cities==Reuters=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/greener--longer-life--more-trees-reduce-premature-deaths-in-cities-12112942=" TBILISI - City dwellers tend to live longer if they are in leafy neighborhoods, according to a study published on Wednesday that linked green areas to lower rates of premature death. Trees in cities are already credited with cooling and cleaning the air and absorbing planet-warming gases, now researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health have found they also keep death at bay. "More green space is better for health," said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, director of the institute's urban planning, environment and health initiative. "People actually live longer if there is more green space around." The research, which pulled data from nine other studies involving more than eight million people in seven countries from China to Canada, was the largest ever conducted on the subject, the authors said. Researchers used satellite images to quantify how much vegetation, including trees, grass and shrubs, was within 500 meters (550 yards) of people's homes. Levels of vegetation were ranked on a scale under a system known as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Those involved in the study were followed for several years. Any premature deaths caused by health conditions such as heart or respiratory diseases were factored in. The study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, found that in cities from Barcelona to Perth, a 10per cent increase in greenery led to an average 4per cent reduction in premature mortality. While researchers did not look into specific causes, Nieuwenhuijsen said access to vegetation was known to benefit mental health, reduce stress, cut pollution and encourage physical activity. "What we need to do is increase green space in many cities ... so that people can actually live a healthy life," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. A "nice green city" would have between 20per cent and 30per cent of every area covered in vegetation, he said. With the United Nations estimating two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050, many cities are already looking at ways to increase greenery, according to the C40 network of cities tackling climate change. Medellin in Colombia has planted thousands of trees to form "green corridors" along main roads, while Australia's Melbourne was looking to almost double its canopy cover to 40per cent by 2040. "Green spaces are good for cities and good for citizens," Regina Vetter, who manages C40's "Cool Cities Network" said in a statement. "Trees, meadows, wetlands and other green space are also vital to prepare our cities for the impacts of the changing global climate. They reduce the risks of flooding, lower temperatures and improve air quality." (Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Claire Cozens.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.

5 COVID-19 patients in Singapore discharged from hospital, 2 new cases reported=17 Feb 2020 08:04PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:25PM)=CNA/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-singapore-update-feb-17-12441176=" SINGAPORE: Five more COVID-19 patients in Singapore have been discharged from hospital, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a daily update on Monday (Feb 17). In all, 24 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Two new COVID-19 cases were also reported on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 77. Case 76 is a one-year-old Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9. The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said MOH. "All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as an added precaution," MOH said. Case 77 is a 35-year-old Singaporean man who has no recent travel history to China. He is a close contact of Case 50, a 62-year-old Singaporean who works at DBS. The 35-year-old was tested positive for the infection on Monday morning and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).    Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7, prompting additional precautionary measures. Earlier on Monday, MOH announced a new Stay-Home Notice for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China outside the Hubei province. From Tuesday, such travellers will be required to stay home at all times during their 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence measure currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example for meals or to buy household supplies. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,700 and infected more than 70,500 in mainland China. It has spread to more than 25 countries, including Singapore, Japan and Thailand.

COVID-19: New Stay-Home Notice with stricter measures for Singapore residents, long-term pass holders returning from mainland China=17 Feb 2020 05:34PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:30PM)=CNA/hs(mi)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-stay-at-home-leave-china-singapore-12442116=" SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Feb 17) announced a new Stay-Home Notice (SHN) for Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from mainland China. As part of the notice requirements, such travellers will have to remain in their homes at all times during the 14-day leave period. This is stricter than the Leave of Absence (LOA) currently in place, which allows them to leave their homes briefly, for example to have their meals or buy household supplies. The SHN will take effect from 11.59pm on Tuesday and will apply to all returnees with recent travel history to China (outside Hubei) within the last 14 days.  With the implementation of the SHN, the Government will no longer be issuing LOAs to such returnees, the health ministry said. "The vast majority on the present regime would have served out their LOAs in the coming days and we will continue to ensure their compliance in the meantime," said MOH. The SHN will also cover returning workers from mainland China on work passes. "For such workers, we already require employers to seek prior approval from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before they travel to Singapore. If employers need help, MOM will link them up with hotels or dormitory operators for their workers to serve out the SHN," said the health ministry. MOH said the implementation of the SHN is "another precautionary measure we are taking to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19". Similar to those placed on LOA, these travellers are not suspected to have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, nor are they unwell or display symptoms of the virus. "These individuals are bearing inconvenience for the benefit of the wider community," said MOH. "We therefore urge all landlords to cooperate and to allow their tenants who are placed on SHN to serve out their full-14 day requirements," it added. The Government said it would continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance to the SHN requirements. There will also be support for those who need help during their SHN period, for example access to food and other daily necessities. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term visit pass holders can seek help from the People's Association. Students can get help from their schools or institutions, or the Ministry of Education. Those on work passes can look for their employers or MOM. 1,200 PEOPLE ON QUARANTINE: LAWRENCE WONG Speaking to reporters on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that there are 1,200 people on quarantine to date. About half of them are in Government quarantine facilities, while the rest are quarantined at home.  The SHN is similar to the Home Quarantine Order, with differences in the requirements for physical isolation. The quarantine order is served to people who have come into close contact with individuals who have been infected, while those serving the SHN are not suspected to have had such exposure. Those under the Home Quarantine Order "need to be separated from other people within the home", said Mr Wong. In comparison, the SHN allows people to share a room with their family members, he added. However, Mr Wong said those who live under one roof with family members under the SHN could practice "common sense" and good hygiene when it comes to preparing food and the use of common utensils. Responding to a question, Mr Wong also said that visits from outsiders were discouraged, but if close family members wanted to visit individuals placed under the SHN, they should take "some precautions". The main requirement is that those served with the SHN do not leave their homes, he added. Long-term pass holders will have their passes revoked if they flout the rules of the SNH, while Singaporeans and permanent residents may face prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Wong.

COVID-19 threat could erode with time just as with H1N1, say experts=17 Feb 2020 06:14AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:05AM)=CNA/hw=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-threat-could-erode-with-time-just-as-with-h1n1-say-12438600=" SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19 infections that started in Wuhan, China and has now spread to almost 30 other countries including Singapore could follow the same trajectory seen in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico just over a decade ago. It could fade into something less sinister later on, said infectious disease experts. In early March 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory illness and increased reports of patients with flu-like symptoms in several areas of the country. This new human H1N1 strain, which originated from swine flu in pigs, swept across the world and by the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate, was responsible for more than 18,000 deaths globally in the 2009 pandemic. JUST ANOTHER FLU BUG WHO declared the virus a public health emergency on Apr 24, 2009. Four days later, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response (DORSCON) from Green to Yellow. This was raised to Orange on Apr 30, when the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from phase 4 to phase 5. But it was not until May 26, 2009 that Singapore saw its first case of H1N1, 15 days after the Ministry of Health (MOH) revised the DORSCON alert back down to Yellow. A 22-year-old undergraduate returning from New York had developed symptoms on the flight and later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak in Singapore peaked in Aug 2009, and the country saw 18 H1N1 fatalities in that year. By the time the DORSCON alert was lowered from yellow to green on Feb 21, 2010, about 415,000 people islandwide had been infected with the virus, with most experiencing mild illness. “Everyone then realised that it was just another flu bug. The initial deaths in Mexico were not seen in Singapore. Very surprising,” said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. “Now when you revisit Mexico, the same virus circulates there, but it doesn’t kill that much.” This is because the threat of H1N1 eroded over the years, he added. And the same is likely to happen for COVID-19, said experts CNA spoke to. VIRUSES BECOME MILDER OVER TIME: EXPERTS Professor Tikki Pang, visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy under the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to stabilise and eventually disappear from public consciousness. “This is the historical pattern of past pandemics, and happens because the virus ‘burns out’ and runs out of people to infect as a result of many factors,” said Prof Pang, citing warmer temperatures, better public awareness and public health measures. “There is a possibility that the virus could mutate into something more ‘sinister’, (that) spreads faster (or causes) more severe disease, but, so far, we have not seen any evidence of this happening.” According to Dr Leong, there are four circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and one of them periodically causes severe pneumonia. “I believe they came into existence much like the current COVID-19. It killed many people and virology or technology was not sufficiently established then to identify the cause of the illness. But it became attenuated with time,” said Dr Leong. “COVID-19 will go the same way. What we need is time for it to accumulate mutations, and it will become milder.” According to Dr Leong, there is a “natural tendency” for viruses to mutate to something milder. If the virus is too pathogenic and it kills its host, it is unable to continue spreading. But if it is mild, it can continue to propagate and pass on to other individuals, eventually picking up mutations that reduce the virus' ability to cause disease, said Dr Leong. He noted that increasing awareness of H1N1 treatment and availability of vaccines also contributed to the threat fading. According to experts, H1N1 is currently a dominant flu strain in Singapore, although this may vary between seasons, and flu vaccines provide immunity against it. Countries in the region face a similar situation - Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control said earlier this month that 56 patients there had died of H1N1 flu virus-affected respiratory failure in the past three months. In the years following the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 became less common globally, but has been on the increase in recent years, said Professor Clarence Tam from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS. "This is likely because, after the pandemic, many people were infected with H1N1 and developed immunity against this influenza strain, so the virus couldn't spread as easily," said Prof Tam. "But we know that immunity against influenza is short-lived, and as the level of immunity drops in the population, more people are now becoming infected with this strain again." Dr Leong said: “It becomes another flu bug. And it helps with the fact that Singaporeans cannot distinguish between flu and the common cold, making the concept of flu in Singapore much milder. “People soon became complacent of H1N1. But, some lethality maintained. If there is a bad case of influenza in the intensive care (unit), it would usually be a H1N1 (case). But overall, we see less and less of a problem.” TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19, H1N1 SIMILAR Speaking at a press conference on Friday (Feb 14), Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had said that it is “clearly emerging” that COVID-19 is different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and has more similarities with H1N1. “The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is different from SARS. In fact, the transmission mechanism is closer to H1N1 or influenza,” said Mr Wong. Researchers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have confirmed this, he added. Researchers found that, like influenza, COVID-19 is infectious when symptoms are mild. Because of this transmission mechanism, COVID-19, like the flu, can spread “quite quickly”, said Mr Wong. “With our mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down - we continue going out even though we don’t really feel well, and that’s how the virus transmits,” he added. Mr Wong also said it was “a matter of time” before “a lot of people around the world” will be infected with COVID-19. Citing the widespread community transmission seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Mr Wong said: “We’re not saying that this will happen for COVID-19. It’s a different disease than H1N1 so the patterns of transmission and the number of people contracting the disease will be different,” he said. "But because the transmission patterns are similar to H1N1, we should be prepared for a scenario where you get wider transmission around the world.” Prof Tam stressed that even if the risk of mortality from a virus is low, it can still cause a large number of deaths if it spreads easily, citing the current COVID-19 outbreak as an example. “The available data indicate that this new virus is not as deadly as SARS, but spreads much more readily from person to person. Consequently, the number of reported deaths has already surpassed deaths from SARS in less than two months,” he said. “The same applies for influenza viruses. Even though the proportion of all influenza cases that succumb to the disease is low, an estimated 300,000-500,000 people worldwide die each year from influenza.” Adding that it is “difficult to predict” whether the COVID-19 will take the same route as the H1N1 pandemic, Prof Tam said: “The concern is that if current efforts to contain the virus aren’t ultimately enough to stamp out human transmission, it could spread rapidly across the globe causing many more hospitalisations and deaths before a vaccine can be developed or enough immunity builds up in the population to bring the epidemic under control.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"
Singapore cuts 2020 GDP forecast range to -0.5% to 1.5% due to COVID-19 outbreak=17 Feb 2020 08:11AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:25PM)=CNA/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-cuts-2020-gdp-forecast-covid-19-economy-12440764=" SINGAPORE: After seeing its economy grow at a decade-low of 0.7 per cent last year, Singapore is expecting possibly even slower growth in 2020 and has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast amid concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Economic growth for this year is expected to come in at around 0.5 per cent, the mid-point of a new estimated range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Feb 17). The previous forecast range announced last November was 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Singapore has so far confirmed 75 cases of the novel coronavirus, with authorities earlier this month raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange. Last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will have a significant impact on the local economy for the next couple of quarters. MTI said its earlier forecast was premised on a modest pick-up in global growth and a recovery in the global electronics cycle this year. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected many countries around the world, including Singapore, and is likely to dampen the growth prospects of China and those impacted. In China, GDP growth in 2020 will likely come in lower than earlier projected due to a pullback in household consumption as a result of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented in several major Chinese cities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it said. Industrial production has also been disrupted due to work stoppages and delays arising from these containment measures, MTI noted in its report. These will, in turn, have a knock-on impact on regional economies through lower outbound tourism and other import demand from China, as well as disruptions to supply chains, it added. “Should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than anticipated, there could be a sharper pullback in global consumption, as well as more prolonged disruptions to global supply chains and production,” the report said. MTI also cautioned that a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in China due to the virus outbreak will negatively affect global trade and economic growth. At the same time, other uncertainties in the global economy remain, such as the US-China trade war and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, it added. As a result, the outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened since its last review in November, the ministry said, adding that the ongoing COVID-19 situation could impact the local economy through several channels. First, the outward-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, will be affected by the weaker growth outlook in several of Singapore’s key final demand markets, including China. Firms in these sectors could also be affected by supply chain disruptions arising from prolonged factory closures and labour shortages in China. Second, there has been a sharp fall in tourist arrivals, particularly from China, and this has badly affected the local tourism and transport sectors. Third, domestic consumption is likely to decline as locals cut back on shopping and dining-out activities. This will adversely affect firms in segments such as retail and food services, the ministry noted. MTI permanent secretary Gabriel Lim said at a press conference that the hit on GDP growth is likely to be felt during the first two quarters of the year, although the impact through these three channels could play out further down the road and will need to be closely watched. The ministry emphasised that while its latest GDP forecast range includes the possibility of a recession, that is not its central scenario and its baseline view is for the economy to see positive growth at around 0.5 per cent for 2020. “As the COVID-19 situation is still evolving, there is a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the outbreak, and hence its overall impact on the Singapore economy,” Mr Lim said. “MTI will continue to monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy closely.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said its monetary policy remains unchanged, as it had highlighted in a statement earlier this month. The central bank is monitoring developments very closely and its next policy review remains as scheduled in April, its deputy managing director Edward Robinson told reporters. 2019 GROWTH SLOWEST IN A DECADE MTI’s report on Monday also showed the Singapore economy expanded by 1 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, slightly above the Government’s initial estimate of 0.8 per cent and the 0.7 per cent growth in the earlier quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, growth came in at 0.6 per cent. This is way below the 2.2 per cent expansion in the third quarter, but above the 0.1 per cent flash estimate. This brings the full-year growth in 2019 to 0.7 per cent, a sharp slowdown from 2018’s 3.4 per cent and hitting the country’s lowest growth since the global financial crisis in 2009. The manufacturing sector was the biggest laggard last year. It contracted by 1.4 per cent, reversing from 2018’s 7 per cent growth, due to output declines in the electronics, chemicals, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters. Construction expanded by 2.8 per cent, turning around from the 3.5 per cent contraction in 2018, supported by both public sector and private sector construction works. The services producing industries also grew by 1.1 per cent, albeit moderating from the 3.4 per cent growth in 2018. Growth largely came from the finance and insurance, other services and business services sectors. For this year, there are still expectations for a “modest growth” in the manufacturing sector, although authorities are closely watching for the impact of COVID-19 on clusters, such as electronics, which have been showing some signs of a tentative rebound, said Economic Development Board’s assistant managing director Kelvin Wong. There are also pockets of relative strength in the Singapore economy, such as the construction sector which is projected to post steady growth given the rebound in construction demand since 2018. The information and communications sector is also expected to be resilient on account of sustained enterprise demand for IT solutions, MTI said. ALL EYES ON “STRONG” BUDGET 2020 Given how the economy is likely to feel the strain from the flu-like virus, economists say a “strong” relief package will likely be announced on Tuesday as part of the Budget, as the Government had promised. Maybank Kim Eng economists, for instance, are pencilling help of at least S$700 million – way higher than the S$230 million relief package released during 2003’s severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Measures to support the hardest-hit sectors may range from tax rebates for commercial, retail and hotels, lower foreign worker levies for tourism-related sectors to bridging loans for smaller firms. The two integrated resorts, which did not exist in 2003, could also receive tax reliefs, the economists said. DBS senior economist Irvin Seah is expecting the Government to put forth an overall deficit of about S$7.9 billion in Budget 2020, the biggest in a decade. “A strong fiscal response is expected to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak,” he wrote in a note. OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling also expects an overall budget deficit of about S$8 billion, which will include a “sizeable COVID-19 relief package and a GST offset package”. And if the deadly virus chills growth further, monetary policy easing will likely be on the cards. Ms Ling said: “Policymakers are also cognizant of the downside growth risks so a strong Budget response and/or monetary policy response in April may help to mitigate and cushion some of the downside risks. “At this juncture, we do not rule out the possibility of the MAS reverting to a zero appreciation path for the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) and regard a re-centering lower as the lower-probability event,” she added. Separately on Monday, Enterprise Singapore cut its 2020 forecasts for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and total merchandise trade, citing likely impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its trading partners and lower oil prices. Both NODX and total merchandise are now expected to come in between -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent this year, down from an earlier projection of zero to 2 per cent growth.

China coronavirus death toll surpasses 1,700; decline in new cases outside Hubei=17 Feb 2020 07:29AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 09:46AM)=Agencies/mn=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-covid-19-coronavirus-wuhan-virus-hubei-new-cases-12440692=" BEIJING: The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,770 after 105 more people died, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 17). More than 70,500 have now been infected nationwide by the virus, which first emerged in December in central Hubei province before spreading across the country. Chinese authorities have placed about 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. New cases outside of the epicentre have been declining for the last 13 days. There were 115 fresh cases outside the central province, according to the commission on Monday - sharply down from nearly 450 a week ago. Local authorities elsewhere in China have introduced measures to try and stop the virus spreading, including a rule in Beijing requiring people coming to the capital to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to official media. Most cases are still in Hubei, where nearly 2,000 were reported on Monday.   The number of reported infections ballooned on Thursday last week after Hubei authorities changed their criteria for counting cases, retroactively adding 14,000 cases in a single day. Monday's figures for new cases were around 100 higher than those on Sunday but still sharply down on those from Friday and Saturday. A spokesman for China's national health authority said that the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled. However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned it is "impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take". International experts have arrived in Beijing and begun meeting with their Chinese counterparts over the epidemic, Tedros said on Twitter. Outside mainland China, Taipei officials reported the island's first death from the new coronavirus on Sunday, as a 61-year-old man from central Taiwan with underlying health problems but no recent overseas travel history died in hospital. He is the fifth person outside of the mainland to die from the virus, with the other deaths in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and France. The biggest cluster outside China is on a quarantined cruise ship outside Japan with 356 infections confirmed, including a quarantine officer. A top US health official on Sunday said 40 Americans from the ship have become infected and would be treated in Japan. Other Americans left the Diamond Princess into the early hours of Monday for chartered jets that would fly them home - and into further quarantine.

14 test positive among US plane evacuees from Japan cruise ship=17 Feb 2020 03:28PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:12PM)=AFP/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-diamond-princess-14-evacuees-infected-united-states-12441826=" WASHINGTON: Fourteen people who had tested positive for the new coronavirus were among more than 300 US citizens and family members evacuated by plane from a quarantined ship in Japan, the US State Department said Monday (Feb 17). The passengers had already disembarked from the Diamond Princess and were preparing to return to the United States on chartered aircraft when US officials were informed 14 of them who had been tested days earlier were positive for COVID-19, it said in a joint statement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). After consultation with HHS, the State Department decided to allow them on board, but isolated them from the other passengers. "These individuals were moved in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialised containment area on the evacuation aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standard protocols," it said. "During the flights, these individuals will continue to be isolated from the other passengers." All passengers were being closely monitored throughout the flights. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialised containment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. The first flight is due to land shortly at a US Air Force base in California, where all passengers will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while a second plane is heading to another base in San Antonio, Texas. Another 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said Monday, citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. The health ministry declined to confirm the reports immediately. More than 600 people are already in quarantine in the United States, evacuated earlier from the virus epicentre in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.

HipVan employee with COVID-19 had close contact with 3 colleagues, stayed home after developing symptoms=17 Feb 2020 06:31PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 06:40PM)=CNA/hw(hm)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-hipvan-employee-covid19-colleague-quarantine-case-70-12442098=" SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old Singaporean woman who was confirmed as Singapore’s 70th case of COVID-19 on Saturday (Feb 15) had close contact with three colleagues, but did not go to work after developing symptoms, said her employer HipVan. The patient is a full-time employee in HipVan’s merchandising department, a HipVan spokesperson said. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), she went to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Feb 14, after seeking treatment at a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3. She had flu-like symptoms from Feb 3 to Feb 7, and was on medical leave that week, said the HipVan spokesperson in response to CNA queries. The patient went back to work from Feb 10 to Feb 12 after recovering and did not exhibit any symptoms. But she felt unwell again on Feb 13 and was told to work from home. She did not come in to work after that, said the spokesperson. The patient did not have any close contact with any clients or partners in the last two weeks, but did have close contact with three colleagues who are now under home quarantine, the spokesperson added. The three other employees have also been advised by MOH to take the necessary precautions to limit contact with their families, she said. “Besides the three colleagues that have close contact with the patient, our management team has also taken additional precautionary measures by getting all the staff that work from our Kallang office to work from home until further notice,” said the spokesperson. “We are also currently assisting MOH personnel with daily phone monitoring of all of our staff and so far, no other staff has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.” HipVan said it will also be working with the Health Ministry to disinfect its Kallang office and close its showroom to visitors until disinfection has been completed. “In addition, we would also like the public to know that our warehouse and delivery teams, managed by third-party service providers, work out of a different location in Tuas, and have had no close contact with the patient in the past weeks,” said the spokesperson.   The patient, Case 70, is a family member of Case 66, linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster. She stays at Mei Hwan Drive and had attended church services at God’s Kingdom Bread of Life Church prior to hospital admission, said MOH on Sunday. On Sunday, Singapore confirmed three new cases of COVID-19, including a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular serviceman, bringing the total number of cases here to 75. There have been 18 confirmed cases linked to the Grace Assembly of God cluster so far.

Thailand reports new coronavirus case, to increase entry screening=17 Feb 2020 02:10PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 02:30PM)=Reuters/hs=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-thailand-new-coronavirus-case-35-12441616=" BANGKOK: Thailand said on Monday (Feb 17) it had recorded one new case of the coronavirus and was increasing screening of visitors from Singapore and Japan entering the country in response to the widening outbreak. The new case, a 60-year-old Chinese woman whose family members earlier contracted the virus, takes the total number of cases in Thailand to 35 since January, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary told a news conference. "This is the from an old case of a Chinese family of nine, all of them have now been infected," he said. Fifteen of the infected people in Thailand have recovered and returned home, while 20 are still being treated in hospital. Some 1,770 people in China have died from the virus, along with a handful in other countries and territories but Thailand has not recorded any fatalities so far. Thai health authorities said they will expand virus screening to cover travellers from Japan and Singapore, in addition to those from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan and Singapore have two of the highest numbers of reported cases outside China. Anyone from those places who displays coronavirus symptoms will be quarantined at a government hospital. "Travellers from Japan and Singapore that developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days of entering the country will be treated like travellers from China," Sukhum said. In addition, Thailand will not allow entry by any foreign nationals who were passengers of the Westerdam cruise ship, now docked in Cambodia, after an American woman tested positive for coronavirus in Malaysia over the weekend. There were 21 Thai nationals on board the ship and health authorities said all of them will be quarantined for 14 days when they enter Thailand.

Did sneezing just give you back pain? It’s more common than you think=17 Feb 2020 06:30AM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 08:07AM)=CNA/bk=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/sneezing-back-pain-causes-remedy-12425854=" Whether it’s the common cold or a reaction to dust or temperature change, sneezing is something we all do almost on a daily basis. But for those who have felt spasms of pain grip their back after a big, sinus-clearing ah-choo, they’d know that sneezing is not to be sniffed at. In fact, sneezing-related back pain is rather common. “We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze,” said Dr Reuben Soh, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Dr Soh added that these patients are often “between 20 and 50 years old”. Furthermore, the odds of throwing your back out isn’t something that exacerbates with age, according to Adjunct Assistant Professor Jacob Oh, the head of spine surgery and senior consultant with the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).   In other words, you don’t have to hit old age to run the risk; it may happen at any time. “As far as I am aware, there is no major study that has shown that age increases the risk of sneezing-related back problems,” said Dr Oh. WHAT’S CAUSING THE PAIN? Sneezing is actually a very forceful action that causes your core muscles to tense up very suddenly, said Dr Oh. At the same time, the intervertebral discs, which are like shock absorbers in your spine, help to cushion the impact. Each intervertebral disc consists of the annulus fibrosus, a sturdy, tyre-like structure that encases a gel-like centre known as the nucleus pulposus. We see around 10 to 20 patients a week who complain of back pain and/or shooting pain in the lower limb following sneezing or while stifling a sneeze. But these shock absorbers can get busted if the sneeze is very forceful and repetitive, resulting in a herniated disc, said Dr Oh. A herniated disc is when the nucleus pulposus gets squeezed out of the annulus fibrosus and bulges into the spinal canal. This, in turn, can cause sciatica, which refers to the numbness or pain shooting down your leg. In some patients, said Dr Soh, the force from sneezing may even tear the annulus fibrosus. WHO IS PRONE TO SNEEZE-RELATED BACK PAIN? For those below the age of 50, sneezing may cause you to throw your back out if you’ve had a previous back injury, said Dr Soh. Similarly, you may be more prone if you used to do high-impact activities such as lifting heavy weights in the gym, or sports with repetitive actions such as tennis or competitive rowing. Dr Soh added that smoking and being obese are other contributing factors.   SHOULD YOU BRACE YOUR BACK BEFORE YOU SNEEZE? There is no need to brace or tense your body, said Ringo Yee, the principal physiotherapist from TTSH’s Department of Physiotherapy. But straighten your body from a twisted or forward-bending position if you’re able to react in time, he said. If you're seated, try to adopt a neutral upright posture. Why is a forward-bending position bad for your back when you sneeze? “Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down,” said Dr Soh. Thus, bending forward while sneezing easily exerts a greater force on the discs, which can increase the risk of tearing the annulus fibrosus and herniating a disc. SHOULD YOU STIFLE YOUR SNEEZE? You shouldn’t. A healthy 34-year-old man did that and ended up busting his throat. The incident, which was reported in the medical journal BMJ Case Reports in 2018, mentioned that the unnamed patient tried to stop a sneeze by “pinching the nose and holding his mouth closed”.   Bad move because shortly after, his throat hurt when he swallowed and there was a “change of voice”. What’s more, his neck was swollen and when he moved it, there was an unsettling popping and crackling sensation. As it turned out, the patient had subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. X-rays taken showed that the air that would have blasted from his nose and mouth made its way into the soft tissues of his neck instead. Sneezing builds up to 3.5 times the normal pressure in the discs compared to lying down. The man recovered in a week or so, and continued to be well after a two-month follow-up. But can it happen to you? “This is rare in the context of the number of sneezes that happen on a daily basis all over the world,” said Dr Stephen Lee, a consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon with Raffles Hospital. “If you are just trying to lessen the loudness of your sneeze, it should not be harmful. But you do not want to totally suppress a sneeze as the sneeze is a defensive reflex to expel foreign particles from the upper airway,” said Dr Lee. I’VE BUSTED MY BACK FROM SNEEZING – WHAT NOW? Don’t panic, said Yee. “Gently try and get back to a neutral sitting or standing position, depending on what you were doing at the time of sneeze. See if you are able to move with relative ease.” If the pain persists beyond the sneeze, take note of where it is. You might also want to take it easy that day, meaning stay off vigorous physical activities, Yee advised.   However, that doesn’t give you the licence to lie in bed and do nothing. “Try and resume your daily activities as much as tolerated over the next few days. Most people recover from their low back pain episodes, so take comfort in that thought,” said Yee. In the meantime, consult your general practitioner for some short-term pain relief. “It usually takes one to two weeks to recover,” said Dr Soh. “But for patients with poor core strength, it can take up to six weeks for the pain to subside. In cases of an annular tear, healing usually occurs naturally between six weeks and three months.” Yee added that if the pain is severe and lasts beyond four weeks, you might want to check in with a specialist. “In rare situations, consult a doctor early if there are symptoms of weakness in the legs, or loss of control of the bladder or bowel,” he said."
No extra restrictions on import of face masks, hand sanitisers; usual GST rules apply: Customs=17 Feb 2020 04:19PM (Updated: 17 Feb 2020 04:20PM)=CNA/hz(aj)=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-no-extra-restrictions-face-masks-gst-customs-12441830=" SINGAPORE: No extra restrictions have been imposed on face masks and hand sanitisers brought into Singapore, the Singapore Customs said on Monday (Feb 17). "No additional Customs restrictions have been imposed on the import of face masks and hand sanitisers," a spokesperson said in response to queries by CNA. "As with all goods brought into Singapore, travellers are required to declare and pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) if the total value of goods imported for personal use exceeds the GST import relief, or the goods are for commercial purposes." The response comes after an image circulating on social media showed a sign put up by the Singapore Customs requesting that travellers who enter the country declare "all face masks and sanitisers", alongside other dutiable items such as tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol.  The Customs spokesperson clarified that the sign depicted in the Facebook post was put up at the Singapore Cruise Centre in response to a "surge in the number of ferry passengers hand-carrying sizeable quantities of surgical masks and hand sanitisers into Singapore". "As a number of travellers had quantities of masks and sanitisers with values in excess of their GST import relief thresholds or which were for commercial purposes, they were stopped at the baggage screening area and turned back to the Customs service counters for GST payment," the spokesperson added. "The sign was therefore put up with good intentions by our frontline staff to remind travellers to make their GST payments first before proceeding for customs clearance, so as to minimise inconvenience and help expedite their clearance at the Singapore Cruise Centre. "Unfortunately, the intent was misconstrued." The Customs spokesperson said that the sign was put up only at the cruise centre to address a specific situation, and that the other checkpoints do not have similar signs. Singapore has seen a surge in demand for face masks amid concern over the novel coronavirus. Some retailers have raised the prices of masks drastically, while private sellers have taken to selling boxes of face masks online, usually in bulk. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Singapore has sufficient masks in its stockpile, and sent letters of demand asking several retailers to explain their pricing strategy for masks.
